We hired a videographer and flew in our photographer and two fellow writers for the occasion, taking over the hulking Titleist Performance Institute for a few hours. (The other attendees won’t be named for purposes of protecting the innocent.)\\nAfter a few minutes of polite conversation, we turned the cameras on and started swinging — which was also the moment I realized I was in for the worst hour of my life. I felt like I swung the club the same way I had for the previous six months of my life, but the result was decidedly not anything I was used to seeing. Instead of my typical gentle hook, I found the most consistent — and deeply horrifying — result of my golfing life: a 70-yard hosel-rocket.\\nThe cameras rolled on my disaster for about 30 minutes. My face turned a new shade of magenta. My entire body tensed with dread. My coworkers begged me to figure it out. It was no use. Phillips, a brilliant swing coach whose clientele includes Jon Rahm, was speechless. I could feel him wince with every shot.\\nI remember hitting 50ish consecutive shanks that day before we finally called the whole thing off — though it’s hard to say how my brain’s trauma response affected my memory of the ordeal.\\nJust writing about it makes me want to vomit.\\nI VOLUNTEER THIS MEMORY to remind us all — myself included — that shanks are human.\\nOf golf’s many shin-kicks, none feel more painful than the hosel-adjacent miss, and yet nobody is capable of avoiding them entirely. Tiger dealt with ’em, Jack dealt with ’em, you deal with ’em and I most certainly deal with ’em, too. Hitting a shank is like stubbing your toe — you just hope when it happens you’re somewhere private enough to shed a tear.      \\nOn Friday evening at the Solheim Cup, Lexi Thompson experienced a painful reminder of this truth. On the 18th green of her second match of the day, a bruising fourball battle with Leona Maguire and Georgia Hall, Thompson faced a tricky chip shot from a sidehill lie and shanked it. It was likely the most pivotal moment of the tournament to that point — the third shot in a tied match with Thompson needing birdie to keep the Americans alive. It ended in disaster.\\nOh no Lexi Thompson #SolheimCup2023 pic.twitter.com/PQedImdbJO\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shank, the U.S. side offered an exemplary look at how one should respond to such a public disappointment. Thompson nearly holed her next shot, a brilliant chip from just off the putting surface, then graciously congratulated both of her opponents on a match well won. Off to the side of the green, her teammates quickly rallied to her defense, offering concerned looks and later, genuine consolation.\\nMegan Khang, the 5-foot-nothing soul of this U.S. squad, even found herself working crowd control.\\n“Now that’s just rude,” she said, whipping around to chide a snickering Euro fan, who quickly shut his mouth.\\nBut the feel-good story only lasted the better part of an hour, until Thompson found herself sitting in the U.S. team’s Friday evening press conference. After fielding a series of softball questions about the quality of her play throughout the day (which, to her credit, had been largely tremendous) and the difficulty of walking 36 holes, Sports Illustrated reporter Alex Miceli was handed the microphone. Finally, he posed the question everyone wanted to hear.\\n“Lexi, could you talk about that third shot on 18?” Miceli asked. “There was some question on what you were trying to do and what you actually did do on the third shot. Could you just go through it for us?”\\nThompson didn’t.\\n“I don’t need to comment on that.”\\n“Excuse me?” Miceli said.\\n“I don’t need to comment on the chip,” she said again, holding her gaze. “It was a bad lie, and I didn’t hit a good chip, but it was pretty much impossible, so…”\\nQuickly, a member of the LPGA’s communications staff swooped in to redirect the conversation, but not before U.S. team captain Stacy Lewis delivered a snipe of her own.\\n“That’s a terrible question,” Lewis said.\\nThe press conference continued as usual after that moment, but the damage had already been done. Suddenly, the shank was awkward.\\nConfounding answer from Lexi and subsequent reaction from the US side. It was one of the pivotal moments of the entire day and somehow that's off limits? pic.twitter.com/9std3LFlmN \\nBY THE TIME MORNING BROKE on Saturday in Spain, Thompson’s response was the talk of the golf internet.\\nSocial media accounts tied to various members of golf media quickly rallied to Miceli’s defense, criticizing Thompson and Lewis for their response to what they saw as a fair and understandable question. Others watching from home, including Thompson’s former Solheim Cup teammate Jess Korda, saw the situation differently.\\n“So sad seeing golf media, yet again, shred Lexi,” Korda tweeted. “It’s easy writing about other people’s mistakes. It’s golf, bad shots happen — give the girl a break. She grows the game more than anyone on tour… And she’s a great player!!”\\nThis isn’t the first time this critique has been surfaced from members of the women’s game — that golf media spends too much time preying on the failures of women’s golf — and we’ve heard it before specifically in regard to Thompson, whose career has been marked by major championship heartbreak on a handful of different occasions.\\nThat is a complex issue, and one always worth considering. But the truth of this situation is actually far simpler than matters of gender or media bias. The truth is that the persisting awkwardness surrounding the shank exists exclusively because of Lexi’s approach to answering the question.\\nYes, it would be every bit fair if she entered that press conference upset about the shot, and it is every bit her right to decline to answer any question she’s asked. It is also every bit her captain’s prerogative to feel protective over her players. It’s also fair to point out that bedside manner is important when asking these questions, and while I might not have found any issue with the Miceli’s forthrightness, Thompson and Lewis might have.\\nIn any case, though, Korda’s right. It’s golf, and bad shots happen all the time. I’m more than willing to give Lexi a break for hitting an ill-timed shank, as I’m sure the overwhelming majority of golf media is. But it’s important to note that the reason the shank became a talking point (rather than just a relatable mistake in a high-pressure situation) didn’t stem from golf media’s ability to give Lexi a break. It came from her response!\\nMiceli wasn’t acting maliciously; he was doing his job, which at the most basic level is to serve as a proxy for the fan. Any fan watching the Solheim Cup on Friday evening wanted to know what happened with Lexi’s chip, and it would be no less than professional malpractice for those in the room not to ask.\\nThompson knows this, and so does Lewis. No athlete survives for more than 15 minutes in the public eye without learning the burden of scrutiny that comes with the job. Some face more scrutiny than others and some handle that weight better than others, but no one is afforded the freedom to avoid it entirely. Without scrutiny (and the fandom, investment and commerce it engenders), there is no professional golf in its current form (nor with its current purses).\\nI’m sure that further down the line, Lexi and Lewis will both admit Miceli’s question caught them in a tense, disappointed moment. That their response wasn’t a reflection of their true feelings about the question, but rather the adrenaline of a high-pressure weekend. But for now we only have that moment — and the resulting response.\\nIT’S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY this issue turned into a landmine.\\nWomen’s golf is underfunded, under-supported and underexposed relative to their male counterparts, which makes the media attention the sport receives significantly more impactful to its success. Good press is good for business, but not all press is good press.\\nIn a social media world where misogynistic comments can run unchecked, it’s hardly difficult to get why some female athletes would take negative coverage personally, or why many of them wish for advocacy from golf media.\\nThe funny thing is, the vast majority of female pros deserve to be advocated for. On the whole they are more generous with their time, happier to accept accountability for their failures and less fearful of vulnerability than their male counterparts. These are the traits that turn ordinary golfers into role models and fan favorites, and those traits are undoubtedly responsible for some of the gains the women’s game has seen over the last decade.\\nIn this era of media distrust, it’s easy to forget the many ways in which media coverage can benefit those being covered. That doesn’t mean the media will always be beneficial, but it sure doesn’t mean they’re inherently corrupt and bad. Those people are often people like me — I’m writing this no more than 20 feet from the Solheim Cup podium — and lord knows I know a thing or two about the shanks.\\nSoon this episode will be but a footnote to an otherwise thrilling Solheim Cup script, a development I’m sure will be welcomed by all parties involved. And when Sunday’s singles matches were announced, Thompson’s name came in the final match of the day, where she’ll face off against Emily Pedersen. As a result, she’ll be a large part of answering the weekend’s biggest question: who hoists the Cup.\\nJames Colgan is a news and features editor at GOLF, writing stories for the website and magazine.

       " 'Author: Nick Piastowski\\nDate: September 23, 2023\\nPublication: golf.com/news\\n\\nHunter Mahan, left, and John Wood during the 2014 Ryder Cup.\\nGetty Images\\nMaybe it’s the home field. Paul Azinger thinks so. \\nOr maybe it’s the home crowd. Or the pressure. Jim Gallagher Jr. thinks so. \\nOr quite possibly it’s all of the above. And then some.\\n“I don’t think there is a true explanation for it,” Azinger said.\\nSpeaking during a conference call to preview NBC’s coverage of the Ryder Cup, the former pros-turned-analysts were trying to dissect why the U.S. Cup team hasn’t won on European turf since 1993. In truth, there are probably more reasons behind it as there are years in the drought itself, and the Americans will get another crack at it starting Thursday in Italy.\\nThen John Wood had a thought. He’s caddied in multiple Cups. \\nSomething concrete has also stood out. \\n“This is probably not going to be the most popular opinion in the world,” he started.\\nOh? \\n“But in my experience, the Europeans outwork us on the putting greens during the practice rounds. They play extremely slowly. We’ve been behind them. We played behind them before. It’s just extremely slow.\\n“If you watch them, it’s a very, very disciplined approach. They work hole locations together with their partners during the practice rounds. The two caddies, the two players, they’ll all work it together. Once they get into the tournament, they’ve got all those putts read. We’re sitting there surprised they make everything.\\n“I think there’s something to do with their preparation. I just think it goes deeper. I think they have a routine that is better for figuring out putts. When you watch the Ryder Cup sometimes, the Americans, when they call their partner in or a partner’s caddie in, it looks a little awkward at times. It’s not very succinct, streamlined. They don’t read putts with somebody all year long and all of a sudden they’re doing it.\\n“I think the Europeans, I don’t know what it is, I’m not saying I know exactly what the thing is, but I think they have a better way to figure out how to putt. I also think they have a theory on the greens, even around the green. Everyone, to a man, I think tells each other the next one doesn’t matter. I don’t care; it’s going to matter probably. I think they go into those putts and those chips thinking the next one doesn’t matter. If you leave your partner with a tough one, so be it.\\n“You watch guys like Colin Montgomerie, Sergio [Garcia], guys over the years who have been good putters, but in Ryder Cups they become great putters.\\n“Those are just something that I thought of for a while. I don’t know if it’s right, just my opinion, a theory that I go with.”\\nWhat did Gallagher think?\\n“I’d have to agree with that, too,” he said on the conference call. “I think they also took the underdog role, whether they were or not. In match play if — the only thing that really matters in everything is that you believe you can beat the other person or the other team. As soon as that other team thinks that you can beat them or they can beat you, that helps.\\n“I think they’ve taken that to heart, too. They’ve convinced themselves that they are as good. It’s like Zinger said, they’re playing great. I think their teams over the years have really changed. World golf, you look at the way the game has changed. These guys have prepared just as much as the Americans. I think both sides want it equally as much. I think it comes down to they’ve taken a little bit different approach.\\n“I’ve never thought about that with preparation with putting. Maybe that’s it. It gets down to making the putt at the right time, and they’ve been able to do that over there.”      \\nAt the least, the idea is worth watching next week. \\nAfter all, consider what Azinger believes is the margin in the event. \\n“But I always looked at the Ryder Cup, in my generation, my era, as being razor thin,” he said on the conference call. “I would compare it to being in Vegas. There’s only a one percent advantage in blackjack, but they’re building some pretty nice hotels on it. \\n“A one percent edge, you can give Europe that one percent edge, you can give them a one and a half percent advantage before we tee it up for a multitude of reasons.”\\nNick Piastowski is a Senior Editor at Golf.com and Golf Magazine.

       " 'Author: Nick Piastowski\\nDate: September 22, 2023\\nPublication: golf.com/news\\n\\nFred Couples last month at the Boeing Classic.\\nGetty Images\\nFred Couples, one of the more vocal critics of LIV Golf, says he’s unsure what the league’s still-to-be-determined future could mean for pro golf. \\nIn an interview this week on CNBC’s Closing Bell — which you can watch here — the popular pro and 1992 Masters winner also explained why he’s attacked the Saudi-backed tour over the past year. But Couples also wondered about LIV, in light of a recently proposed coming together between its backer, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, and the PGA Tour.        \\nWould LIV remain, following a year-plus fight with the Tour? That is still to be decided, at least publicly. An agreement between the sides says only “a full and objective empirical data-driven evaluation of LIV and its prospects and potential” would be undertaken, and in the time since the proposal was announced, Tour officials have mostly stuck to that line. But should LIV fold, there’s also the question of its players, many of whom left the Tour for large, guaranteed contracts and were subsequently punished by their former series for exiting.\\nThere, the agreement says “PIF, the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour will work cooperatively and in good faith to establish a fair and objective process for any players who desire to re-apply for membership with the PGA Tour or the DP World Tour following the completion of the 2023 season,” and Tour officials have also been mum on what that process could look like. Couples, though, is curious. \\nFor clarity, here is the exchange he had with host Scott Wapner. \\n“Do you hope it [the proposed agreement] doesn’t happen?” Wapner asked. \\n“I never thought it [LIV Golf] would happen,” Couples said. “I never thought they would get off the ground, but I guess when you have — I’m not even smart enough to figure out how many billions — you can get people to follow the money. I don’t know if it’s going to go away. Again, Scott, that’s another great question. \\n“I’m so old that I don’t — I pay attention to every golfer that plays on the PGA Tour, but if it goes away, is that going to be good? I don’t know if that’s going to be good or not. Can we intertwine? I’m not smart enough to figure that out. I’m sure they will try and do something.”\\nAt this point in the CNBC interview, Couples noted Brooks Koepka, a LIV player who’s playing next week in the Ryder Cup, where Couples will be a vice-captain. \\n“But we do have Brooks Koepka on the Ryder Cup team — he’s not really a PGA Tour player and every player on that team wanted him, so we still have some nice feelings about the LIV guys,” Couples said on CNBC. “But would I want to see it go away? It doesn’t matter to me really anymore if — their tour is set, they have their 48 guys, I don’t think any new guys have joined in five or six months, so it is what it is.”   \\nThe CNBC comments follow a flurry of thoughts from Couples on LIV.\\nThere were his thoughts last June to GOLF’s Alan Bastable, with a headline entitled “‘I’m done with it:’ Fred Couples dismisses LIV Golf, Phil Mickelson.” About a month later, there was more from Couples, with GOLF’s headline on those comments reading “‘I’m glad they’re gone’: Fred Couples’ latest LIV roast targets Tour critics, Greg Norman.” And about a month later, there was more still, with this GOLF headline saying, “Fred Couples’ LIV attack continues with thought on … birthdays and weddings.”  \\nBut why the barrage at all? \\nOver the past year, Couples has explained that, and on Closing Bell, Couples explained again, though here he was reflective. For clarity again, here is the complete exchange, started by Wapner.  \\n“I don’t think it’s news to anybody you’ve been one of the most popular players on tour for an awfully long time, well before you even won the Masters in ’92. So when you speak, people listen to what you have to say, and you’ve been one of the most outspoken players, I think, about the LIV tour and the future of that relationship with the PGA Tour. I’m wondering: What was your first reaction when you heard of this potential deal between LIV and the PGA Tour?”\\n“You know, what a question,” Couples started. “And I’ve answered it the same every single time. It affects the PGA Tour immensely. But really what affected me is how these guys leaving — not all of them; some of them; I shouldn’t even say five of them — were talking about the PGA Tour, how bad of a tour it was, how wrong it was, how they’re better off playing in the LIV tour. I’ve spent — this is my 43rd year on the PGA Tour. I represent it the best I can. I’ve played a long time. The Champions Tour, Scott, as you know, is great.        \\n“But it just offended me that — go play your golf, go play in your 54-hole events — we all know that’s funny to talk about. And sometimes I felt bad about what I said. But you know when I talked to other people, I really don’t think I said anything horrific — I just reacted to what some of the guys that left said. Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson — I don’t talk to Dustin that much, but Brooks, I’ve kept in touch since this Ryder Cup thing, [and] we laugh every other day about stuff. And I have no qualms with 99 percent of the guys. It affects the Tour. I’m no longer on that tour, but what affected me is just the things they had to say.”',\n",

I’m good, thank you. Got any more?\\nDD: Trying to ease into things here. How would you assess your season so far?\\nTF: I’ve been playing well this year. Been playing consistently, and driving the ball much better. Definitely the last few tournaments, performance-wise and results-wise, they’ve been very solid. So I’m focused on those positive things.\\nDD: When you’re feeling good about your game, does that dial in your practice sessions to little tweaks rather than big changes?\\nTF: I try not to make anything I’m working on too big, especially at tournaments. I think the time you’re home is when you get to experiment with a few ideas that you might have; tournaments aren’t the best time to do that. Any changes take time, and, at tournaments, you’re always trying to cover other things. But, in general, I’m trying to stay ready. I’m trying to improve, bit by bit, every day.\\nDD: Tell me about your new home base.\\nTF: In Dubai?\\nDD: In Dubai. How long have you lived there full time?\\nTF: Full time since last summer. Y’know, for us guys that grew up on the DP World Tour, we always spent a lot of time in Dubai. We have friends there. And last year, my second academy opened up there, and the kids got the chance to go to school there. It just felt like a good time to move, knowing if we didn’t do it now, then we probably would never have done it. But it’s been really, really good. I’ve enjoyed it.\\nDD: Given the schedule of a professional golfer, how much are you home?\\nTF: [Laughs] Not a lot. But it’s just something that we’re used to and we manage the best we can.\\nDD: Before Dubai, your home base was England. This year’s Open Championship is coming to Hoylake. You grew up about 20 miles up the coast, in Southport. What’s that part of the UK like?\\nTF: Ah, well, it’s always been home for me. Amazing place for golf. Friendly people. I don’t end up on the town that much anymore, so I wouldn’t be able to tell you much about what’s going on in town center these days. But I always enjoyed growing up there. Seaside town. Golfing town. So I was always surrounded by people who had the same sort of passions as I did.\\nDD: What were you like as a kid?\\nTF: Um, chubby. [Laughs.] Not that into school. I mean, I guess I enjoyed school, but I wasn’t into the academic side. I really loved golf. I’d come home from school, my dad would take me to the range, and that’s all I wanted to do.\\nDD: Did you play other sports?\\nTF: Only for school. I’d play all the school sports: football, cricket, hockey — that’s field hockey for you. But, honestly, I was a distinctly very, very average athlete.\\nDD: Really? You must have good hand-eye coordination.\\nTF: Eh, I dunno.\\nDD: Ping-Pong? Darts? Cornhole?\\nTF: I guess I’m actually not too bad at cornhole. Definitely better at that than darts. I like the extra weight.\\nDD: The Open course, Hoylake, aka Royal Liverpool — did you play there growing up?\\nTF: One of my close friends was a member, so we played it, like, once or twice a year. I know the course well enough to walk ’round it. Do I know the intricacies of it? No. Plus, we would always play it in winter conditions, very soft and stuff. But it was my first Open, Hoylake in 2014, so it’ll be a home venue like it was at Royal Lytham. It’ll be very cool going back there.\\nDD: You were 23 in 2014. You’re 32 now. What do you remember of that first Open?\\nTF: How nervous I was going to the first tee. And then I didn’t play very well. But, seriously, I just remember how nervous I was playing my first Open.\\nDD: Who are the folks on Team Tommy?\\nTF: Well, I’ve got Fino [gestures in the direction of caddie Ian Finnis]. He’s a staple. And Phil Kenyon, who I work with on putting. [Short-game coach] Graham Walker. And I’ve been working a bit more closely with [swing coach] Butch Harmon and [mental coach] Bob Rotella this year. They’ve been helping me out. There’s my trainer, Kolby Tullier. And, obviously, my wife and manager, Clare.\\nDD: That’s a star-studded group. So, to connect those ideas, how has your tournament prep changed from, say, your first Open?\\nTF: I think you’re always learning how to prepare best. I think you’re always learning about your game. And you understand how little your play in practice relates to your play when you take off on Thursday — just as long as you’re ready. So I think there’s a lot more emphasis on being ready than anything else. I still love preparing for golf tournaments. I enjoy these days where you get to learn a new golf course, major venues especially, where you’re learning how you’ll get around.\\nDD: How have you changed physically? Are you swinging faster now than then?\\nTF: I think training with Kolby this year has been great. Training with Kolby and then having Butch on the phone has been a really good combination to look at how I’m swinging it. And, for sure, those things have helped me from a consistency basis week to week.\\nDD: I’ll feel as if I haven’t done my duty if I let you go without asking about golf ’s geopolitics. Is there a take you’ve been waiting to fire off about LIV and the Tour but just haven’t found the right time?\\nTF: Not really. It’s up to the governing bodies. I’ve never put myself in a position, nor do I want to be in a position, where I am deciding on other people’s whereabouts, on where they can play and can’t play. I like to focus on where I want to play and how I can become the best golfer I can be.\\nDD: With that in mind, what would make you happy at the end of the season? Like, Man, this year, I accomplished this!\\nTF: Win the next three majors. Yeah, I think that should do it.\\nDylan Dethier is a senior writer for GOLF Magazine/GOLF.com.

       " 'Alan Bastable\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2023\\n\\nThompson has the word \"Faith\" inked on her right arm.\\ngetty images\\nNot many professional golfers have tattoos, but there are some outliers. Max Homa has “Relentless” inked on the outside of his right wrist. Bubba Watson has his wife’s name, Angie, tatted on his left ring finger. Among the handful of permanent markings on Rickie Fowler: the signature of his late swing coach, Barry McDonnell, on the inside of his left wrist.\\nAnd then there’s Lexi Thompson, who you might have been watching on Golf Channel over the past couple of days. As a member of the U.S. Solheim Cup team, which is squaring off against their European counterparts in a tight contest in Spain, Thompson already has helped her side pick up two points with an opportunity for a third point still in the balance: her Sunday singles showdown against Emily Pedersen of Denmark.\\nThompson has three visible tattoos: the Olympic rings on the inside of her left wrist; an arrow and the word “Faith” on her right forearm/wrist; and, on the inside of her right wrist, flower heads with “Psalm 46:5” inked just above. As you might expect, each holds important meaning to Thompson.\\nThe Olympic rings speak to Thompson’s patriotism, of which she has an abundance. That was evident in the run-up to the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, when Thompson’s primary mission for the year was earning the right to represent her country.\\n“Ever since I found that golf was back in the Olympics, I’ve just been prepping for that,” Thompson said after the first round of the women’s Olympic event. “That was my No. 1 goal, to be on this team. I’ve just been working really hard on my game trying to tighten everything up and work on the mental side of it, as well, because I know that’s a big factor in golf.”\\nThompson was asked if playing in the Olympics was a higher priority than trying to bag another major title. \\n“To me, yes,” she said. “I think the Olympics is higher than any major. We have five majors a year, and we only have one Olympics every four years, and golf is back in it since 1904. I don’t think there’s a comparison to having a gold medal.”\\nThompson finished 19th in the event but not landing on the podium did nothing to quell her national pride.  \\nFour years later, when she got the call confirming that would she would again be playing for Team USA, this time at the Tokyo Games, she said she got chills. “That was my No. 1 goal going into the year, and I busted my butt on the practice facilities to get that locked up,” she said. (Thompson finished well down the board again, in 33rd, but did get to see her compatriot, Nelly Korda, take gold.)  \\nEarlier this year, Thompson played in a golf outing that honored the U.S. Navy SEALs, a branch of the military for which she has long shown support. At a pro-am in Virginia years ago, she made a memorable entrance, skydiving onto the course from 10,000 feet with an assist from a retired Navy SEAL; the leap was intended to promote her partnership with the SEAL Legacy Foundation, which supports families of wounded and fallen SEALs.\\nThis week, in Spain, there was no doubting what Thompson’s spot on the Solheim Cup meant to her. In her first press conference of the week, she wasted little time in saying so. “It’s my No. 1 goal to be on that team to be able to represent my country,” she said. “It’s my favorite event by far. There’s nothing like waking up, putting country’s colors on, and going to represent and be alongside a team at that.”\\nThompson is reminded of that feeling every time she looks at the inside of her left wrist, which is where she had the Olympic rings inked in the fall of 2017. “Something I’ve wanted to get ever since I went to the Olympics, can’t be more honored that I was able to represent the USA in Brazil” she wrote on Instagram. “So much meaning behind this tattoo and it will always remind me of all my hard work. I will wear these rings with pride.”\\nThompson’s two other tats hint at another core part of her makeup: her Christian faith. The more visible of the two is on the outside of her right forearm. Applied in 2019 in blank ink, the tattoo depicts an arrow with the word “Faith” in script.\\n“The arrow is just to keep on going forward,” Thompson told Golfweek soon after she had commissioned the body art, which she said, on a pain scale of 1 to 10, was a 4. “God will have me on the right path.”\\nLower on the same arm, on the inside of her wrist, Thompson has more lettering above a floral pattern: “Psalm 46:5,” which, according to the New International Version of the Bible, reads: “God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.”\\nThompson has, on occasion, used social media to express the importance of her faith. After a first-round 64 at an LPGA event in Thailand in 2016, she wrote on Instagram: “Have faith, keep believing in God’s promises, he is always faithful. God blesses the faithful and those who honor Him. I remind myself everyday that I should be grateful for everything and everyone I’ve been blessed with in my life.”\\nThree days layer, Thompson won the event by six, marking what at the time was her seventh LPGA victory. (She has won four more times since then.)\\nOn Sunday, Thompson will try to add another bullet to her resume, in one of the biggest spots of her career. With the Solheim Cup knotted at 8-8 after the first four sessions, Thompson is playing in the anchor match for the U.S.\\nOn Saturday evening, she was asked how she’s feeling after having played three matches on the hilly host site, Finca Cortesin.\\n“Ready to go,” she said.\\nAdded Thompson’s Saturday foursomes partner Megan Khang: “I think this week is just purely adrenaline. If you feel like you’re tired, you forget about it because the crowd’s right there picking you up. You have your partner looking at you going like, ‘Let’s go.’ Lexi is literally like, ‘Come on, we can do it.’ I’m like, ‘I can do it. My little legs can keep up.’\\n“Lexi’s a beast.”\\nAs GOLF.com’s executive editor, Bastable is responsible for the editorial direction and voice of one of the game’s most respected and highly trafficked news and service sites.

       " \"James Colgan\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2023\\n\\nLexi Thompson's Solheim Cup shank wasn't the talk of the golf world on Saturday — but her response to it was.\\nGetty Images\\nCASARES, Spain — Early in my GOLF.com career, I caught a devastating case of the shanks.\\nIt was fall 2021 and I was in Southern California for a video series based around a swing lesson from legendary swing coach Dave Phillips. We hired a videographer and flew in our photographer and two fellow writers for the occasion, taking over the hulking Titleist Performance Institute for a few hours. (The other attendees won’t be named for purposes of protecting the innocent.)\\nAfter a few minutes of polite conversation, we turned the cameras on and started swinging — which was also the moment I realized I was in for the worst hour of my life. I felt like I swung the club the same way I had for the previous six months of my life, but the result was decidedly not anything I was used to seeing. Instead of my typical gentle hook, I found the most consistent — and deeply horrifying — result of my golfing life: a 70-yard hosel-rocket. \\nThe cameras rolled on my disaster for about 30 minutes. My face turned a new shade of magenta. My entire body tensed with dread. My coworkers begged me to figure it out. It was no use. Phillips, a brilliant swing coach whose clientele includes Jon Rahm, was speechless. I could feel him wince with every shot. \\nI remember hitting 50ish consecutive shanks that day before we finally called the whole thing off — though it’s hard to say how my brain’s trauma response affected my memory of the ordeal. \\nJust writing about it makes me want to vomit. \\nI VOLUNTEER THIS MEMORY to remind us all — myself included — that shanks are human. \\nOf golf’s many shin-kicks, none feel more painful than the hosel-adjacent miss, and yet nobody is capable of avoiding them entirely. Tiger dealt with ’em, Jack dealt with ’em, you deal with ’em and I most certainly deal with ’em, too. Hitting a shank is like stubbing your toe — you just hope when it happens you’re somewhere private enough to shed a tear. \\nOn Friday evening at the Solheim Cup, Lexi Thompson experienced a painful reminder of this truth. On the 18th green of her second match of the day, a bruising fourball battle with Leona Maguire and Georgia Hall, Thompson faced a tricky chip shot from a sidehill lie and shanked it. It was likely the most pivotal moment of the tournament to that point — the third shot in a tied match with Thompson needing birdie to keep the Americans alive. It ended in disaster. \\nOh no Lexi Thompson #SolheimCup2023 pic.twitter.com/PQedImdbJO\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shank, the U.S. side offered an exemplary look at how one should respond to such a public disappointment. Thompson nearly holed her next shot, a brilliant chip from just off the putting surface, then graciously congratulated both of her opponents on a match well won. Off to the side of the green, her teammates quickly rallied to her defense, offering concerned looks and later, genuine consolation.\\nMegan Khang, the 5-foot-nothing soul of this U.S. squad, even found herself working crowd control. \\n“Now that’s just rude,” she said, whipping around to chide a snickering Euro fan, who quickly shut his mouth.\\nBut the feel-good story only lasted the better part of an hour, until Thompson found herself sitting in the U.S. team’s Friday evening press conference. After fielding a series of softball questions about the quality of her play throughout the day (which, to her credit, had been largely tremendous) and the difficulty of walking 36 holes, Sports Illustrated reporter Alex Miceli was handed the microphone. Finally, he posed the question everyone wanted to hear.\\n“Lexi, could you talk about that third shot on 18?” Miceli asked. “There was some question on what you were trying to do and what you actually did do on the third shot. Could you just go through it for us?”\\nThompson didn’t.\\n“I don’t need to comment on that.”\\n“Excuse me?” Miceli said.\\n“I don’t need to comment on the chip,” she said again, holding her gaze. “It was a bad lie, and I didn’t hit a good chip, but it was pretty much impossible, so…”\\nQuickly, a member of the LPGA’s communications staff swooped in to redirect the conversation, but not before U.S. team captain Stacy Lewis delivered a snipe of her own.\\n“That’s a terrible question,” Lewis said.\\nThe press conference continued as usual after that moment, but the damage had already been done. Suddenly, the shank was awkward.\\nConfounding answer from Lexi and subsequent reaction from the US side. It was one of the pivotal moments of the entire day and somehow that's off limits? pic.twitter.com/9std3LFlmN\\nBY THE TIME MORNING BROKE on Saturday in Spain, Thompson’s response was the talk of the golf internet. \\nSocial media accounts tied to various members of golf media quickly rallied to Miceli’s defense, criticizing Thompson and Lewis for their response to what they saw as a fair and understandable question. Others watching from home, including Thompson’s former Solheim Cup teammate Jess Korda, saw the situation differently.\\n“So sad seeing golf media, yet again, shred Lexi,” Korda tweeted. “It’s easy writing about other people’s mistakes. It’s golf, bad shots happen — give the girl a break. She grows the game more than anyone on tour… And she’s a great player!!”\\nThis isn’t the first time this critique has been surfaced from members of the women’s game — that golf media spends too much time preying on the failures of women’s golf — and we’ve heard it before specifically in regard to Thompson, whose career has been marked by major championship heartbreak on a handful of different occasions. \\nThat is a complex issue, and one always worth considering. But the truth of this situation is actually far simpler than matters of gender or media bias. The truth is that the persisting awkwardness surrounding the shank exists exclusively because of Lexi’s approach to answering the question.\\nYes, it would be every bit fair if she entered that press conference upset about the shot, and it is every bit her right to decline to answer any question she’s asked. It is also every bit her captain’s prerogative to feel protective over her players. It’s also fair to point out that bedside manner is important when asking these questions, and while I might not have found any issue with the Miceli’s forthrightness, Thompson and Lewis might have.\\nIn any case, though, Korda’s right. It’s golf, and bad shots happen all the time. I’m more than willing to give Lexi a break for hitting an ill-timed shank, as I’m sure the overwhelming majority of golf media is. But it’s important to note that the reason the shank became a talking point (rather than just a relatable mistake in a high-pressure situation) didn’t stem from golf media’s ability to give Lexi a break. It came from her response!\\nMiceli wasn’t acting maliciously; he was doing his job, which at the most basic level is to serve as a proxy for the fan. Any fan watching the Solheim Cup on Friday evening wanted to know what happened with Lexi’s chip, and it would be no less than professional malpractice for those in the room not to ask. \\nThompson knows this, and so does Lewis. No athlete survives for more than 15 minutes in the public eye without learning the burden of scrutiny that comes with the job. Some face more scrutiny than others and some handle that weight better than others, but no one is afforded the freedom to avoid it entirely. Without scrutiny (and the fandom, investment and commerce it engenders), there is no professional golf in its current form (nor with its current purses).\\nI’m sure that further down the line, Lexi and Lewis will both admit Miceli’s question caught them in a tense, disappointed moment. That their response wasn’t a reflection of their true feelings about the question, but rather the adrenaline of a high-pressure weekend. But for now we only have that moment — and the resulting response.\\nIT’S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY this issue turned into a landmine.\\nWomen’s golf is underfunded, under-supported and underexposed relative to their male counterparts, which makes the media attention the sport receives significantly more impactful to its success. Good press is good for business, but not all press is good press. \\nIn a social media world where misogynistic comments can run unchecked, it’s hardly difficult to get why some female athletes would take negative coverage personally, or why many of them wish for advocacy from golf media. \\nThe funny thing is, the vast majority of female pros deserve to be advocated for. On the whole they are more generous with their time, happier to accept accountability for their failures and less fearful of vulnerability than their male counterparts. These are the traits that turn ordinary golfers into role models and fan favorites, and those traits are undoubtedly responsible for some of the gains the women’s game has seen over the last decade.\\nIn this era of media distrust, it’s easy to forget the many ways in which media coverage can benefit those being covered. That doesn’t mean the media will always be beneficial, but it sure doesn’t mean they’re inherently corrupt and bad. Those people are often people like me — I’m writing this no more than 20 feet from the Solheim Cup podium — and lord knows I know a thing or two about the shanks.\\nSoon this episode will be but a footnote to an otherwise thrilling Solheim Cup script, a development I’m sure will be welcomed by all parties involved. And when Sunday’s singles matches were announced, Thompson’s name came in the final match of the day, where she’ll face off against Emily Pedersen. As a result, she’ll be a large part of answering the weekend’s biggest question: who hoists the Cup.\\nJames Colgan is a news and features editor at GOLF, writing stories for the website and magazine.

       " \"Dylan Dethier\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2023\\n\\nCarlota Ciganda is off to a red-hot 3-0 start at the Solheim Cup.\\nGetty Images\\nThe Solheim Cup is tied, 8-8.\\nSo we don’t know the winner yet. We don’t know the loser.\\nBut let’s not let that stop us. Which people, players and philosophies won Saturday?\\nHere they are: 10 winners (and, just for balance, losers) from Day 2 at the Solheim Cup.\\nAfter the U.S. swept the first foursomes session 4-0 on Friday, things looked a bit dire for the host squad. The sweep was so jarring it transcended basic match play; the U.S. advantage felt philosophical. Stacy Lewis was leaning on an analytical approach to her pairings and that approach was working.\\nBut a 3-1 Friday afternoon triumph brought Europe closer. A 2-2 Saturday morning split maintained the U.S. team lead. And another dominant European afternoon — 3-1, again — brought the match dead even. That included some unpredictable lineup moves, like playing the team’s lowest-ranked golfer Emily Pedersen in all five matches. European captain Suzann Pettersen has been coaching by feel, and that earned a mixed response on Friday. But it’s been working, too.\\nSuzann Pettersen’s press conference was something else. My favorite part… pic.twitter.com/mI6GuB6yVg\\n“This is a different event,” said Pettersen. “It’s about energy, adrenaline, momentum. It was almost hard for me to pick and choose who was actually going to go out this afternoon because we had so many that were just red-hot and ready to go.\\n“So I mean, it was literally almost flip a coin for some of them who I picked at the end. But we tried to base it off stats, tried to match up as good as we could, and it worked out fairly good.”\\nThe contrast in styles, personalities, approaches — it’s terrific.\\nWhen some golfers play a lot, others inevitably play very little. Let’s be clear: Dryburgh is not herself a “loser” in any sense. She hasn’t even lost a match this week! But after gutting out a half-point on Friday afternoon, Dryburgh was benched all Saturday. She and Caroline Hedwall — who teed it up for the first time on Saturday afternoon — are the only players to tee it up just once in the first four sessions.\\nLexi Thompson and Lilia Vu lost their Friday fourball match in heartbreaking fashion when Thompson shanked a greenside eagle chip on No. 18 to lose 1 Down. It would have been easy to let that carry over into Saturday foursomes; it didn’t. Thompson and red-hot partner Megan Khang went 2 down to the European side of Anna Nordqvist and Leona Maguire but weathered the storm and made par after par to eke out a 1 Up victory. Thompson’s 2-1-0 record through team play is a huge success.\\n“That’s the whole thing with match play, you can never give up, and you never know when it can turn, so you have to stay in it and stay in the moment,” Thompson said after her match. It was cool seeing her so invigorated; this year hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows. Speaking of which…\\nThompson declining to answer questions about said Friday afternoon shank was noteworthy, but the video of that exchange didn’t make its way to the collective golf internet until Saturday morning when posted by No Laying Up‘s Tron Carter.\\nConfounding answer from Lexi and subsequent reaction from the US side. It was one of the pivotal moments of the entire day and somehow that's off limits? pic.twitter.com/9std3LFlmN\\nWhat’s the big deal? Why the big response? Thompson is, of course, well within her rights to not talk about the least pleasant moment of her week. And Thompson has had understandable gripes with press coverage over the years. But I think the way she and Lewis acted as though the question should never have been asked seemed to set people off.\\nOur James Colgan wrote more about the entire thing here, so dive in. But I think the takeaway is actually pretty simple here. If you’re advising Lexi Thompson, just tell her to acknowledge the moment! Let us in! It was a tough chip! We all suck at chipping! We’re all even worse at chipping under pressure! That’s golf. The question was inevitable. Better to take ownership of the moment and get people on your side rather than keeping them out.\\nNot only did Yin appear to be having the most fun of any Solheim Cup contestant, but she also appeared to be pummeling the longest drives. Yin hadn’t earned a point heading to Saturday’s afternoon session — and she and partner Cheyenne Knight were 2 down through 10 holes. But then the pair reeled off several birdies to keep Europe from sweeping the session. That was punctuated by Yin hammering some sort of mid-iron into 18, a par-5 where most players have been laying up, setting up a two-putt birdie and a match victory.\\nIcing the match 🧊Angel Yin reached the green in two on 18 to help @SolheimCupUSA win a much needed point in Spain 👏 pic.twitter.com/8kExsms0qF\\nIt was surprising to see World No. 2 Lilia Vu sit the first session. But it was far more surprising to see her lose in each of the next three sessions. None of the three were blowouts — she reached the 18th hole on Friday and the 17th hole in both matches on Saturday — but Vu is the only American without at least a half-point.\\nIt’s not often you see a right-handed golfer nail a left-handed fist pump. Tiger Woods is the godfather of the modern golf fist pump, after all, and his is consistent: hold the putter in the left hand, pump with the right. But Grant has had plenty of opportunities to celebrate through four matches — she’s 3-1, having played all four sessions — and the lefty thing is growing on me.\\nNo right-handed golfer has ever really mastered the lefty fist pump but I feel like Linn Grant is getting there pic.twitter.com/HdNKXIYAz3\\nThe real point here: Linn Grant is very, very good at golf. There are very few women better than Linn Grant at golf. I’m not sure there’s anyone in this cup I’d want to face less in a match.\\nHey, TV people: Help out my little hamster brain, please! I need help remembering the match scores. I need help remembering who is playing who. We need some context! I kept a leaderboard tab open on my laptop while watching just to keep track of the matches; that feels like the broadcast’s job. (And yes, I considered the possibility that I’m just an idiot but plenty of others on the internet seemed to share this particular gripe.)\\nThere’s only one golfer at this week’s Spanish Solheim Cup who hails from Spain. There’s also only one golfer who has a 3-0 record. The fact that those are the same golfer is nothing short of remarkable. Kudos to Carlota Ciganda, who was already an emotional center for the European side before she started toppling opponents like dominos.\\nScenes on the 16th as Carlota sends @SolheimCupEuro  2UP in the final match 🇪🇺#TeamEurope | #SolheimCup pic.twitter.com/l8IHkkKHiZ\\nThis is a personal pet peeve: when pros are “freed up” to hit must-make putts with no consequences for missing, some take the opportunity to absolutely rifle the ball past the cup. But that’s not how putts go in! We’ve dived into these numbers before. When the ball approaches the hole at dying speed, the hole is effectively much bigger. I get why pros try to take out some break by hitting the ball harder, and there’s something to be said for it, but if a putt goes like 10 feet past the hole it probably wasn’t going in on any line.\\nOkay, I said I was just going to do 10 and now we’re at 11. But I can’t go without shouting out Leona Maguire — who’s an absolute menace — plus her semi-injured partner Charley Hull. The two teamed up to take down Nelly Korda and Ally Ewing 4 and 3 on Saturday afternoon. Shoutout also to Madelene Sagstrom, who picked up her first team victory in her sixth team match across three cups. Shoutout to Emily Pedersen, who went from a fringe captain’s pick to must-watch TV — not just because of her ace but because of everything that came after. And shoutout to us, the viewers. An 8-8 tie is a hell of a way to go to Sunday singles.\\nSee you there!\\nMatch 1, 5:10 a.m. – Megan Khang (USA) vs. Linn Grant (EUR)\\nMatch 2, 5:22 a.m. – Rose Zhang (USA) vs. Leona Maguire (EUR)\\nMatch 3, 5:34 a.m. – Danielle Kang (USA) vs. Charley Hull (EUR)\\nMatch 4, 5:46 a.m. – Jennifer Kupcho (USA) vs. Anna Nordqvist (EUR)\\nMatch 5, 5:58 a.m. – Andrea Lee (USA) vs. Georgia Hall (EUR)\\nMatch 6, 6:10 a.m. – Cheyenne Knight (USA) vs. Gemma Dryburgh (EUR)\\nMatch 7, 6:22 a.m. – Angel Yin (USA) vs. Celine Boutier (EUR)\\nMatch 8, 6:34 a.m. – Ally Ewing (USA) vs. Caroline Hedwall (EUR)\\nMatch 9, 6:46 a.m. – Lilia Vu (USA) vs. Madelene Sagstrom (EUR)\\nMatch 10, 6:58 a.m. – Allisen Corpuz (USA) vs. Maja Stark (EUR)\\nMatch 11, 7:10 a.m. – Nelly Korda (USA) vs. Carlota Ciganda (EUR)\\nMatch 12, 7:12 a.m. – Lexi Thompson (USA) vs. Emily Pedersen (EUR)\\nDylan Dethier is a senior writer for GOLF Magazine/GOLF.com.

It\\'s a slate wiped clean for the ultimate fresh start. Everyone\\'s on equal footing again, in an official erasure of whatever happened -- good or bad -- the prior campaign.\\nThat opening puck drop doesn\\'t come without months of preparation, though, and we\\'re not just talking in the gym. Getting game-day ready goes beyond just the weight a player can handle on the squat rack -- to how they manage the load of inevitable expectation on their shoulders.\\n\"I think the hardest part of pro hockey and being in the NHL isn\\'t necessarily the physical part,\" Anaheim Ducks forward Troy Terry told ESPN at the NHL\\'s player tour in Las Vegas this month. \"It\\'s the mental side of things.\"\\nAnd how. Terry is one of several top skaters within their organizations who\\'ve recently learned that lesson -- among others -- the hard way. Focusing on the body -- how it\\'s fueled, trained and rested -- is (relatively) easy to control. But there\\'s no guarantee it translates into on-ice results.\\nWhen there\\'s a disconnect between the two, doubt naturally creeps in. Pressure ramps up.\\nTerry felt that in Anaheim last season during what was just his second full NHL campaign. Tom Wilson, coming off his 10th season with the Washington Capitals, went through a frustrating ride of his own in 2022-23. Veterans and newbies alike can\\'t escape a down, disappointing, or demoralizing year. But they can all use it as an opportunity to snap back -- and level up.\\nThat\\'s why, after a too-long summer for too many NHLers, the 2023-24 season can\\'t begin soon enough. When it does, some skaters will be eyeing their own sort of resurgence -- whether coming off injury, a disappointing individual performance or by simply trying to prove (to themselves, and everyone else) why this season will be better than ever.\\nTERRY COULDN\\'T UNDERSTAND what happened in mid-December last season.\\nAfter scoring 12 goals and 28 points in his first 31 games, he hit a wall.\\nHard.\\n\"I went 16 games at that point last year without scoring a goal, which was tough for me,\" Terry said. \"When I look back at it, I think I played well, I was getting points, but for whatever reason during that time I just could not score. And it put my goal totals off for the rest of this year.\"\\nThat roadblock was uncharted territory for Terry on the heels of his much-lauded breakout effort. The 26-year-old made waves in 2021-22 -- his first full NHL season -- producing 37 goals and 67 points in 75 games, becoming the youngest Ducks player in franchise history to record a point streak of 15 games or longer, and being voted to his first NHL All-Star Game appearance.\\nThose stats not only put Terry on the NHL\\'s radar in a major way, they earned him a seven-year, $49 million contract extension in the offseason that committed some of the best days of his playing career to Anaheim.\\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\\n• Four NBA teams likely to improve »\\n• Barnwell explains big NFL surprises »\\n• Bold predictions for all 32 NHL teams »\\n More ESPN+ content »\\nTerry anticipated not just meeting any newfound expectations associated with the long-term deal, but surpassing them. But on an Anaheim squad deep into rebuilding, it was Terry who found his own foundation shaken despite notching a solid 23 goals and 61 points through 70 games.\\n\"It\\'s funny, I had similar point totals [in 2022-23 as before], but my goal [numbers] being off was hard,\" he said. \"But as a player, I think I took steps, and it\\'s nice when we have a young team, and I was lucky enough to sign a long deal. So, I think my focus is just being a good hockey player and being a good teammate this year. That usually helps translate into points.\"\\nTaking a cue from his home base in the eternal summer of Southern California, Terry is determined to maintain a sunny mindset. His newest housemate has been an invaluable source of inspiration in that respect; Terry and his wife, Dani, welcomed Greyson James in April, a life-changing experience that put everything -- including hockey -- into much-needed perspective.\\n\"Having a kid and everything that\\'s changed [because of that] in my life, you start to not live or die by how you\\'re doing on the ice,\" Terry said. \"You realize there\\'s more important things in your world. Not that hockey is not important, but you\\'re more than just a hockey player. And I think that\\'s been my mentality switch, and when you\\'re going through times like that [without scoring], it helps.\"\\nTerry said he\\'s \"really excited\" now for the season ahead even as the Ducks\\' continued retool is bound to bring about its own challenges. Like it or not, growing pains come with the domain for Terry, on the ice and at home. It\\'s the latter life, though, that truly brings Terry the most joy these days, even if -- like his day job -- there are highs and lows through which to wade.\\n\"Fatherhood is harder than I ever thought it would be,\" Terry admitted. \"But I also love that guy more than I thought I could love something. So, it\\'s been pretty fun.\"\\nVETERAN TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING DEFENSEMAN Mikhail Sergachev might appear soft-spoken.\\nBut what he does say hits hard.\\n\"I want to get to the top,\" Sergachev said. \"I want to be the best: on our team first, and then in the league.\"\\nThat\\'s exactly the mic drop mentality Tampa Bay needs from its burgeoning star. The 25-year-old blueliner was acquired by the Lightning in 2017 to eventually be where he is now -- cresting their defensive depth chart as one of the team\\'s highest-paid players thanks to an eight-year, $68 million contract kicking in this season.\\nSergachev doesn\\'t take the team\\'s commitment to him lightly. He produced the best season of his career across the board in 2022-23, tallying 10 goals and 64 points in 79 games, averaging a team-high 23 minutes, 49 seconds of ice time per game, and earning a significant role on the Lightning power play.\\nIt was disappointing, then, for Sergachev -- and the Lightning at large -- to see how they came up short in a first-round playoff loss to Toronto. Tampa Bay\\'s run of back-to-back Stanley Cup victories, followed by another Cup Final appearance, set a high standard that Sergachev is determined not to let slip. Especially given the profound impact the team\\'s investment in his future has already had.\\n\"I appreciate it a lot,\" Sergachev said. \"When they gave me an eight-year deal, like I don\\'t want to say I didn\\'t expect it, but I just felt that they trusted me and they believed in me, and it changed my perspective on a lot of things. It made me believe in myself more.\"\\nWhat that translates to over the next few years is on Sergachev to create. It\\'s likely no coincidence the new pact coincided with Sergachev\\'s excellent season. The goal now is to recreate that success individually, and hope it also rubs off on the rest of his team.\\n\"I understand things better now,\" Sergachev said. \"I signed a long-term deal. The team trusted me on the first power play [last season]. So, it\\'s a lot of responsibility going into this season. Every year, every summer, every training camp that I take, I have to focus on that [responsibility] and give it everything I have.\"\\nONE OF THE top rising stars in the league, Jason Robertson has a singular focus with the Dallas Stars this season.\\nAnd it\\'s echoing like a mantra: consistency.\\n\"I don\\'t want to just be catching fire and then not really doing a whole lot later in the season,\" Robertson said. \"It\\'s just staying that same player I can be and having that high expectation to try to play the best I can offensively, but do it consistently and try to maintain the other aspects of the game as well at the same time.\"\\nIf Roberson\\'s goal-setting ability is anything like his goal-scoring one, then the Stars are in for a treat. Because their top-line winger is ready to fly even higher.\\nThe 24-year-old was a behemoth on the ice in 2022-23, producing 46 goals and 109 points in 82 games to rank him seventh and sixth, respectively, overall in the NHL. For context, the only skaters who notched more points than Robertson were Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl, David Pastrnak, Nikita Kucherov and Nathan MacKinnon.\\nBut the postseason was a different story, as he scored just two goals and 10 assists in the opening two rounds (including no goals in seven games against the Kraken), before coming alive against Vegas in the conference finals.\\nRobertson talks about his game as a work in progress, and he\\'s dialed in on maintaining good habits.\\n\"If I\\'m consistent in what I do and what I play, the numbers will take care of themselves,\" he said. \"That\\'s just what happens. You work hard, you don\\'t get complacent, then you know you\\'re going to get opportunities. You\\'re going to get chances. You play on too good of a team not to; too good of a roster not to get those opportunities. So, it\\'s up to me to just try to stick to that [mindset], keep working hard and don\\'t get complacent.\"\\nThe same could be said for the Stars overall. Dallas put together an 108-point season under first year head coach Pete DeBoer and advanced to the Western Conference finals. The Stars came up short there in a six-game loss to the eventual Cup champion Golden Knights, but the result has done nothing to curb Robertson\\'s enthusiasm for what Dallas can accomplish in the coming season.\\n\\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\\n\"It\\'s winning it all,\" he said. \"That\\'s what you want to do. We have those expectations. We have the players, the coach that it takes the win. Everyone has a recipe to win. We\\'ve got a big forward group, great defensemen, an elite goalie. You have all those criteria that were checked off.\\n\"So, we have high expectations this year, and we\\'re fortunate enough to where our GM [Jim Nill] has built this group well. And the young guys are going to step up and take control, like me and the younger guys. So, we\\'re excited.\"\\nHere\\'s where Robertson will digress, though. Yes, as a fourth-year pro, there is a natural progression toward shouldering more locker room duties and being a good example. Just don\\'t anticipate Robertson breaking away from who he\\'s been all along. On and off the ice, Robertson\\'s moves have served him and the Stars well.\\nThe right formula now is just generating more of what works -- even more often.\\n\"All I\\'ve got to do is keep working hard, keeping playing the right way and just lead by example,\" he said. \"I like to say I\\'m a leader. I have a big responsibility in myself to not put myself ahead of the team in any situation, so I think I\\'ve been doing a good job in that. I\\'m ready to get back at it.\"\\nTHERE\\'S WISDOM IN growing older as a person and a hockey player.\\nCapitals winger Tom Wilson can attest that\\'s the truth.\\n\"You kind of learn to live in the moment,\" Wilson said of getting deeper into his career. \"You take it game by game. Right now, we have a really good group of guys in our room. Age obviously doesn\\'t really matter if everyone\\'s playing well and doing their thing and winning games. People like to look to the future and plan, but our job as players is to win each game, win every night, and if you do that, the rest will take care of itself.\"\\nIdeally, Wilson would like to contribute more to the winning part this season than he was able to recently. The 29-year-old missed the first half of 2022-23 recovering from offseason ACL surgery. He made it back into the lineup by January and lasted a mere eight games before a blocked shot against Colorado caused a \"small, small fracture\" in an ankle that was big enough to sideline Wilson through mid-February.\\nStill, the winger was a productive player for Washington, producing 13 goals and 22 points in 33 games. And GM Brian MacLellan recognized Wilson\\'s value with a massive seven-year, $45.5 million contract extension that starts next season to carry Wilson through (presumably) the majority of his remaining NHL seasons.\\nBut those extended absences last season were some of many that ultimately doomed the injury-plagued Capitals to a down season. Washington recorded the fourth-most man games lost amid ailments to Wilson, Nicklas Backstrom, T.J. Oshie and John Carlson; it was no surprise by the March trade deadline to see MacLellan trading players away, torpedoing any lingering hope Washington had of making the playoffs.\\nWilson says now he\\'s \"feeling good; a lot better\" than the previous offseason and used an extended summer to get his body back in the game, so to speak.\\nNext is trying to bring Washington back from the brink. The Capitals have a new head coach in Spencer Carbery, a milestone machine on a mission in Alex Ovechkin and, with a healthy Carlson, Backstrom and Wilson, some legitimate optimism for the year ahead.\\nThat\\'s what Wilson will cling too, anyway. Even if the 2022-23 season ended with a thud, there\\'s reason to believe the coming campaign can open with a bang.\\n\"I think [my goals] all revolve around team success,\" Wilson said. \"We want to get back to where we want to be. We want to have that winning culture and mentality that we\\'ve built for the last 10-15 years in Washington. And if I\\'m doing my job, if I\\'m playing well, I think it\\'ll help the team win games, and that\\'s the most important thing.\"\\nAnd if Wilson has to take over a bigger role -- whether on the ice or in the dressing room -- he\\'s prepared to learn on the fly there, too.\\n\"I\\'m pretty fortunate to have had so many leaders to look to, and now I\\'m in the middle of my career and in the second wave [to start standing up],\" he said. \"But those guys [like Ovechkin and Backstrom] are the best and I love having them around and just try and soak it all in when you can.\"\\nFORGET THE CLICHED \"roller-coaster ride\" analogy.\\nFor the past two years, Nashville Predators forward Filip Forsberg has been on a carnivalesque Tilt-A-Whirl, complete with thrilling highs and stomach-dropping lows.\\nLet\\'s recap: It was only in 2021-22 when Forsberg emerged with a breakout season, collecting 42 goals and 84 points in 69 games for a Predators team that defied expectations earning a postseason berth. Forsberg parlayed his success into a mammoth new deal with Nashville, avoiding free agency in the summer of 2022 by agreeing to an eight-year, $68 million extension.\\nThe Predators -- and Forsberg along with them -- seemed well positioned to rise even further in 2022-23. Until the wheels fell off.\\nInstead of thriving out of the gate, Nashville immediately fell into a fight just to keep pace in the playoff race. The Predators were four points out of a wild-card spot in February when Forsberg -- then the team\\'s second-leading scorer with 19 goals and 42 points in 50 games -- suffered a concussion against Philadelphia.\\nForsberg never returned for the Predators. The team\\'s alarming number of injuries -- to him, Roman Josi, Ryan Johansen, and others -- led to Nashville spiraling out of postseason contention from there.\\nThe fallout came fast and furious. Head coach Jon Hynes was fired (and eventually replaced by Andrew Brunette). GM David Poile finalized his retirement, with Barry Trotz taking over. And Trotz wasted no time giving Nashville a face-lift, buying out Matt Duchene\\'s contract, trading Johansen to Colorado and adding veterans such as Ryan O\\'Reilly, Gustav Nyquist and Luke Schenn in free agency.\\nIt\\'s been 24 months of whiplash, basically. What Forsberg needs now is some rejuvenation -- with a side of stability.\\n\"You kind of have to see it that way,\" he said about rebounding this season. \"You miss 32 games [in 2022-23], you feel like you had a tough year. It might not have been as bad as it felt, but at the same time, you don\\'t play for half the season, it\\'s obvious you\\'re going to have to bounce back and try to find something to build off. I\\'m excited just to get a chance to be out there competing with my teammates again.\"\\nThe Predators\\' locker room looks different than before, too. Forsberg is one of a few remaining veterans from Nashville\\'s lineup in 2021-22, a clear indication of how the organization has pivoted toward its up-and-comers (including Philip Tomasino, Cody Glass and Thomas Novak).\\nIf Forsberg is wearied by all that change, he doesn\\'t show it. If anything, he\\'s attempting to flourish from it, and holds faith that he and the Predators can make the most of what awaits this season.\\n\"I feel great. I\\'m excited about [what\\'s next],\" he said. \"I think our [retooling] has been done correctly, so to speak. Obviously, you don\\'t want to see any of your friends and teammates leave, but at least we\\'ve done a good job trying to replace them with other players, and I\\'m excited to get to know Coach Brunette as well.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Author: Coley Harvey\\nDate: Sep 25, 2023, 07:00 AM ET\\nPublication: espn.com\\n\\nNEW YORK -- Aaron Judge was quiet.\\nWhen asked what he learned about his team during a difficult first year as captain, the five-time All-Star took a full 16 seconds before responding. From his locker at the far end of the New York Yankees clubhouse, Judge stood, his eyes scanning the room as his mind scanned everything that happened this year.\\n\"Honestly,\" the 31-year-old outfielder said, \"this really tested everybody\\'s character. It tested my character.\"\\nFor the first time since Judge made his MLB debut in 2016, the Yankees\\' bad days outweighed the good. On Sunday, whatever still-existing playoff dreams the team might have had were officially dashed when a loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks eliminated New York from postseason contention. And throughout the Yankees\\' final homestand, which ends Monday, Judge and his teammates admitted this has been a year they hope to never repeat.\\n\"You kind of get tested at a time when things aren\\'t going your way, when guys get hurt, you\\'re not getting the call that you want, the ball\\'s not falling the way that you want it to,\" Judge told ESPN. \"It challenges you to continue to show up every day and compete. This just really tested guys. You\\'ve really got to want to be here. You\\'ve really got to want it and bring it every single day.\"\\nThe Yankees\\' 2023 season ends Sunday in Kansas City. Instead of a postseason, as October begins, the Yankees will be taking vacations, going on fishing trips, spending time with loved ones, reconditioning their bodies and resetting their minds. They certainly won\\'t be playing for a World Series.\\n\"When you come to New York, you\\'ve got to win. It\\'s about winning a World Series,\" Judge said. \"If you don\\'t win a World Series, it\\'s like: \\'What are we doing?\\'\"\\nAfter getting as far as the American League Championship Series in three of the past six seasons, the Yankees will be at home in October for the first time since 2016.\\nAlthough there is a belief throughout the club that this season will ultimately be a minor blip, that doesn\\'t change the reality of what could\\'ve been.\\n\"You take it very personally,\" said manager Aaron Boone, whose job security after his fifth season in charge remains a question entering the offseason. \"We have to own it, and I have to own it. We are the leaders of this team, and you\\'ve got to take the good with the bad.\\n\"We pour a lot into this, 365 days a year, to be a championship-caliber team, and when we fall short of that ... that\\'s tough.\"\\nNobody knows that better than second baseman Gleyber Torres, who was called up in 2018. For the first time in his career, he won\\'t be playing any meaningful games in October.\\n\"How we play right now is just like, we don\\'t want that,\" Torres said. \"We want to play like how we were last year -- just consistency every day.\"\\nAt this point, it isn\\'t surprising that this is the way New York\\'s season is ending. Injuries and offensive inconsistency have plagued the organization since early June, making this the year\\'s long-anticipated destination.\\nAhead of Opening Day, though, there were vastly different expectations. On paper, the Yankees were an elite squad thought to be a serious AL contender. Coming out of spring training, ESPN\\'s panel of experts ranked them as MLB\\'s fourth-best team, with an 88% chance of making the playoffs and the highest World Series odds of any team.\\nFor Judge, all that makes it even more frustrating that this happened on his watch -- and while he was on the sideline for much of the season, missing 51 games with a toe injury.\\n\"Not being out there for the guys every single day, and not helping them give us an opportunity to get to the postseason, that kills me,\" Judge said. \"Me getting hurt, I felt like I impacted the team and impacted their chances.\\n\"That eats at me every night.\"\\nWhether your favorite team is an October favorite or playing out the string, every club has had something go right ... and wrong.\\n Stock Watch »\\nThe Yankees could be inclined to trace the start of their season\\'s demise back to June 3, when Judge crashed into the right-field wall at Dodger Stadium while chasing a deep fly ball. As his 6-foot-7, 280-pound frame ripped through the gated, chain-link portion of the fence, his right foot struck a concrete siding that runs along the very bottom of the outfield wall.\\nThe full-speed impact resulted in a torn ligament in his right big toe, sending Judge to the injured list.\\nDuring that stretch, the Yankees also lost a number of other players to injuries and inconsistent performance. The 2022 All-Star battery of catcher Jose Trevino and pitcher Nestor Cortes went down with season-ending injuries. First baseman Anthony Rizzo suffered post-concussion symptoms from an incident in May and missed significant time, as did starting pitchers Luis Severino and Carlos Rodon, designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton and other once-key Yankees -- including Josh Donaldson and Harrison Bader -- who aren\\'t even on the team anymore.\\nThough Judge\\'s lengthy absence from injury won\\'t be remembered as the only factor that led to New York\\'s downfall this season, to him, none of that matters.\\n\"It just goes back to: You only get so many years to get a chance to play here in New York,\" Judge said. \"I just signed a long-term deal, so I\\'m going to be here for a couple more years, but there are guys we don\\'t re-sign or they\\'re going to be a free agent, and this could be the one chance to make a postseason or make an impact in New York. And I kind of take responsibility for that.\\n\"Not giving them a chance to see what it\\'s like in a postseason in October in New York hurts. Them missing out on an opportunity like that, I take full responsibility for that. That\\'s on me. I\\'m the one going out there every single day. I\\'ve got to go out and show up and put our team in the best position.\"\\nBoone was not surprised that his star player was laying so much of the fault of the season\\'s failures at his own feet.\\n\"He\\'ll have games periodically during the season where he\\'ll have this great game and then not get a big hit in a big spot and he\\'ll be: \\'It\\'s on me. It\\'s on me,\\'\" Boone said. \"He just expects a lot.\"\\nDespite seeing a dip in his batting average (from .291 to .268) since returning from the toe injury July 28, Judge has nonetheless been a welcome presence in the Yankees\\' lineup down the stretch. With two series to go, he has 35 home runs, good for fourth in the AL.\\nLast week he became the first Yankee with multiple three-home run games in a single season. Both came after his IL return, helping assuage concerns about his recovery and reigniting hope for next season.\\nJudge will be back, obviously, as will ace Gerrit Cole, who capped what is expected to be a Cy Young Award-winning season by tossing an eight-inning two-hitter Thursday night -- a performance in which he took a perfect game into the sixth.\\n\"It\\'s disappointing that we\\'ve had the season that we\\'ve had, that\\'s for sure,\" Cole said. \"But regardless of if you\\'re in it or you\\'re not, as a professional, you\\'ve got to do your job. Sometimes you have to find different ways to get energy, or to focus in games that are maybe obviously a little less intense than they are if you\\'re competing for the division ... [but] people are buying tickets, you\\'re getting paid a salary and honestly, it is still fun.\"\\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason.\\n Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\\nJudge takes solace in the team\\'s rebound after the last time it missed the playoffs. The 2016 squad went 84-78, and, with a run for the division crown seemingly out of reach by that August, the club called up Judge and other young prospects. They finished fourth in the division -- and then made six straight postseason appearances.\\nThe message that Judge -- the only current Yankee to have played in games for that 2016 team -- received from veterans like Brett Gardner, CC Sabathia, Brian McCann, Mark Teixeira and Carlos Beltran at the time was to keep doing the work. Keep improving.\\n\"That was probably the most powerful lesson: Just because you made it up here doesn\\'t mean that the journey is over, that the work\\'s over, that the grind\\'s over,\" Judge said. \"Getting up here and seeing guys like Mark Teixeira, in spring training seeing Alex Rodriguez and Beltran. They\\'re future Hall of Famers, and they\\'re still working on their craft. Even at age 38, 39, 40.\\n\"You\\'ve got to make adjustments. You can\\'t be satisfied. It\\'s just an eye-opening thing for a lot of guys that hey, the journey\\'s not done. Don\\'t be satisfied just because you get the call-up.\"\\nIt\\'s the same message that he, Cole and the few other veterans in this current clubhouse have passed on to the sizable group of young Yankees, like rookie shortstop Anthony Volpe and outfielder Jasson Dominguez, who made their debuts or got significant late-season call-up time this year.\\n\"Throughout the whole year it\\'s been a wake-up call. And as much as we\\'ve stuck to our routines, there are things that we need to do differently to be better next year,\" 28-year-old pitcher Michael King said. \"It\\'s not a fun position to be in. We don\\'t like being here, and I\\'m hoping that all of us don\\'t like being here, and we\\'ll make that transition.\"\\nThat attitude is what gives Judge confidence in the team\\'s improvement next year. He credits the team\\'s ALCS appearance in 2017 in part because of how badly the squad wanted to erase the disappointing ending the year before. The 2024 group will need to follow suit.\\n\"I didn\\'t like the taste of having everybody in the clubhouse, and when the last game was over, that was it,\" Judge said. \"Just having that taste and seeing the disappointment and seeing the veterans talk about it. I said, \\'I don\\'t want to experience this. I want to be playing the last game of the year all the way to the end.\\'\\n\"So that\\'s one lesson we can take out of this. We\\'ve got a lot of improvements, and a lot of things we\\'ve got to work on and fix for the upcoming years. And the time for that starts now.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Author: Sarah Barshop\\nDate: Sep 25, 2023, 06:00 AM ET\\nPublication: espn.com\\n\\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- As Los Angeles Rams general manager Les Snead, coach Sean McVay and vice president Tony Pastoors realized the changes that were coming to their defense following a disappointing 2022 season, they wanted to check in with their future Hall of Famer.\\nAaron Donald sat with them in Pastoors\\' office before the start of free agency, where they discussed what the defense might look like in 2023 around the three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year. The Rams knew they\\'d likely be \"losing guys that have been big-time contributors.\"\\n\"He\\'s a great competitor,\" McVay said of Donald. \"He loves a challenge, but I think you don\\'t want to catch people off guard. And the best thing that you can do, and what I\\'ve learned and it certainly hasn\\'t been perfect, is let\\'s try to do that. Try to be able to give people an honest understanding of where we\\'re headed.\"\\nDonald\\'s reaction resonated with Snead.\\n\"He looked you in the eye and said, \\'Here\\'s the deal ... I\\'m good, just make sure they care,\\'\" Snead said.\\nDonald, widely considered one of the best defensive players ever, has been named first-team All-Pro seven times. The defensive tackle, who finally added Super Bowl champion to his resume during the 2021 season, was up for the challenge.\\n\"I just said, \\'Bring in guys that\\'s hungry, that\\'s just willing to work, and that\\'s willing to just find ways to tune up and not be satisfied with just being here,\\'\" Donald said. \"Obviously, you getting a bunch of new guys, and as long as they come in working with the mindset to want to get better we can win with that.\"\\nUnlike last year, the expectations for the team\\'s 2023 success were low. Cornerback Jalen Ramsey was traded to the Miami Dolphins, linebacker Bobby Wagner returned to the Seattle Seahawks as a free agent, defensive tackle A\\'Shawn Robinson signed with the New York Giants, linebacker Leonard Floyd joined the Buffalo Bills and nose tackle Greg Gaines headed to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\\nDonald was not fazed \"because it\\'s like ain\\'t no pressure at all.\" Now in his 10th season, Donald has played 140 games, all with the Rams. He has 103.5 sacks, which includes at least a half-sack on 50 different quarterbacks, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\\n\"Obviously, the past couple years you been praised so high, now everybody is against you kind of thing,\" Donald said. \"You hear it, but me personally, kind of trying to feed off it a little bit because we all need something to try to push us a little bit. So it is different, but I\\'m for the challenge.\"\\nAlthough Donald, 32, is in the second half of his career and wants to win now, he has welcomed the opportunity to lead a young team. As the Rams prepare for the Cincinnati Bengals on \"Monday Night Football\" (8:15 ET, ESPN/ESPN2), it\\'s clear that a roster many thought would be a rebuild is capable of winning games. On defense, a large part of that is because of the presence of Donald, not only during games but in the way he has led his young teammates.\\n\"Not just in this draft, but in many drafts, we\\'ve often somewhat joked, \\'OK, does this meet the AD standard?\\'\" Snead said.\\nOften when Snead is evaluating a player in the draft, he\\'ll see someone who \"passes the beauty contest\" with the skill level \"but maybe from a love of the game standpoint doesn\\'t really cut it.\"\\n\"And it\\'s like, \\'Oh man, I don\\'t know if he passes the AD test,\\'\" Snead said. \"So we\\'ve definitely done that over the years as a barometer, as a standard.\"\\nJUSTIN LOVETT HAS a list on his office whiteboard with 15 names on it. It\\'s \"AD\\'s body count,\" a list of players who have tried -- and failed -- to complete a workout with Donald since Lovett was hired in 2020 as the Rams\\' director of strength and conditioning.\\nThis year, rookie defensive linemen Kobie Turner and Desjuan Johnson joined Lovett\\'s list early during training camp. Turner\\'s entry came the first week of camp. Though he wasn\\'t keeping up with Donald, he was \"doing some of the stuff he did, just at a slower pace.\" But on the second day of their workout, Turner \"caught a cramp halfway through and they had to send me down.\"\\n\"It is hard to keep up, but that just goes to show how bad do you really want it?\" Johnson said. \"I\\'d be midworkout and I\\'m like, \\'Damn, we ain\\'t done yet,\\' he still wants to do some more. I\\'d just be like, \\'I can\\'t complain. That\\'s what it takes to be the best.\\' So I tried my best not to complain. I just embraced the moment and towards the end of the camp as we working out, I asked him, \\'S---, you ready? What else you want to do?\\'\"\\nWhen asked for his workout routine, Donald smiled and said, \"I just do a lot of work.\"\\n\"Obviously, the days I\\'m able to get a lot of extra work in, I\\'m in there with [Lovett] working certain things,\" Donald said. \"I like to look good. So certain things I feel like is getting a little mushy, make sure I keep it feeling the right way.\"\\nDonald has yet to identify a rookie who can keep up.\\n\"They ain\\'t been too steady with it,\" he said.\\nBefore a newcomer tries to work out with Donald, Lovett said, he\\'ll try to get him to work his way up to the volume the All-Pro is doing.\\n\"We talk \\'em through it,\" Lovett said. \"Say, \\'He\\'s going to do three sets, he\\'s going to do four sets, maybe you start off with two.\\' But they don\\'t want to hear that. They want to be AD. There needs to be a ramp for those guys. So, he\\'s got people that can hang with him for a little bit, but usually it\\'s not as consistent as he would like.\"\\nEven though Donald wants a challenge, Rams defensive line coach Eric Henderson said he sees the defensive tackle continue to outwork everyone because \"that\\'s who he is. He doesn\\'t take second.\"\\n\"He wants somebody to be competitive with,\" Lovett said. \"He doesn\\'t just want to be cooperative and bring you along, he\\'ll bring you in to beat you and to watch you suffer because that actually gives him a little bit more stamina and juice.\"\\nWHEN TURNER MAKES a mistake on the field, he knows he\\'s going to hear about it. The rookie said Donald isn\\'t hard on his teammates in the meeting room, but if you \"get punked a little on the play, he\\'ll make little sound effects.\" Henderson is in on the bit, and he\\'ll replay the clip to let Donald continue to make the sound effect -- noises designed to make sure those in the room knows he sees the player on the field getting \"owned,\" Turner said.\\n\"I wouldn\\'t say he teases you, but he definitely let it be known that he seen what happened,\" Johnson said. \"So if a play didn\\'t go your way, he\\'d be like, \\'Mmmm,\\' like damn. One of them, I\\'d be like, \\'Wow, he seen that.\\' It helps you in a way because when you out there on the field you like, \\'I don\\'t want AD to see something bad that he start talking junk.\\'\\n\"So it helps you in a way of trying to be on yourself, so when a play do come up and your play is on the field, you made the play and instead of making sound effects he\\'ll say \\'good game, good s---.\\'\\nHenderson says this helps \"keep it loose in that room and allow those guys to be themselves.\"\\nSound effects aside, there\\'s also a lot of learning going on. Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris called Donald a \"quiet leader.\"\\n• Rams\\' Donald isn\\'t slowing down\\n• Can Bengals protect Joe Burrow?\\n• Bucs getting it done without Brady\\n• Can Eagles keep Brown-Smith WR duo?\\n• What\\'s wrong with Jaguars?\\n• Elliott looking forward to facing Cowboys\\n\"People don\\'t give him credit for is his above-the-neck approach to the game,\" Henderson said. \"He has an elite feel for what\\'s going on out there on the field, and that\\'s why he\\'s able to anticipate what\\'s happening and play the way he\\'s played. ... He\\'s big-time for these guys that haven\\'t played a lot of ball. They\\'re able to pick his brain.\"\\nWhether it\\'s talking to linebacker Byron Young about how to sell his rush or going against rookie left guard Steve Avila in practice and showing him pass-rushing moves he has never seen done that way before, Donald is always teaching.\\n\"There\\'s a couple times where he\\'s grabbed my back shoulder,\" Avila said. \"I\\'m like, \\'Dude, I\\'ve never had that happen to me.\\' But then again, in a way of making yourself better is like, \\'OK, how do I not let that happen?\\'\"\\nAnd while Donald has a wealth of knowledge, McVay said he chooses his spots to be vocal.\\n\"There\\'s nothing more powerful than showing instead of saying, and so he shows what it looks like,\" McVay said. \"He shows what it looks like to do right in the meeting room, on the practice field, the way that he competes relentlessly in every single opportunity he gets. The great ones elevate people around them, and I think we would all be in agreement and in alignment that certainly Aaron is checking all those boxes.\"\\nTHROUGH TWO GAMES, the Rams\\' defense -- which has two starters remaining from the Super Bowl lineup -- ranks 28th out of 32 teams in total DVOA.\\nAt the start of the season, the Rams had the second-youngest team (25.49 years) -- behind the Green Bay Packers (25.3) -- with 15 rookies on the 53-man roster.\\nWhile this squad has a far different look from veteran-heavy past Rams teams, Los Angeles hopes its young and hungry roster built around Donald, 32, will compete with the best in the NFL in the near future.\\n\"We got to just keep working,\" Donald said. \"Obviously, none of us is there yet, but we looking good. I feel like we looking good, we got them flashes where we look like the type of defense we want to be. It\\'s just about being more consistent and trying to play mistake-free football.\"\\nThe confidence comes from having a future Hall of Famer leading the way.\\n\"[Donald] sets a really high standard for the guys in his room and really that whole defense,\" quarterback Matthew Stafford said. \"And they all know they got to go out there and play at a really high level because they got one of the best of all time, if not the best of all time, going out there with them.\\n\"He raises everybody around him.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Author: Victoria Matiash\\nDate: Sep 10, 2023, 08:00 AM ET\\nPublication: espn.com\\n\\nWhile it feels like only yesterday the Vegas Golden Knights made owner Bill Foley look like the most prescient prophet in professional sports, here we are with the 2023-24 NHL regular season nearly upon us. Isn\\'t it wonderful? Which means it\\'s also occasion to gather all your favourite fantasy hockey-loving mates, or form/join a new league, and get back to the fabulous business of managing a team to eventual glory. Or, at least give it the best possible go. Allow us to try to help you in that endeavour, beginning with the most important few hours of your entire fantasy season.\\nThere\\'s no better occasion to adopt Scouting America\\'s timeless motto than ahead of the most important two to three hours of your entire fantasy hockey season. You best Be Prepared, or 2023-24 could turn into a long and arduous fantasy affair. Some advice then, largely, but not only, in step with ESPN\\'s standard points re-draft league, to help you build the strongest team possible when it matters most.\\n\\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\\nSign up today!\\nDraft the best player available. If Connor McDavid is unspoken for, pick him. If not, grab his teammate Leon Draisaitl. Then David Pastrnak, Auston Matthews, Nathan MacKinnon and so on. Let others focus on outside-the-box picks in respect to position or sleeper potential, you\\'ll have plenty of opportunity to out-clever other managers in later rounds. To start, load up on all available superstars - those who put up the sexiest scoring numbers, full-stop - up front. Unless there\\'s some ridiculous early run on goalies, I\\'m leaving that position alone until the third round, at minimum, depending on league size. Because did you project Linus Ullmark would leave all other netminders in his fantasy dust ahead of last season? Neither did I. But I had sufficient faith in McDavid, Draisaitl, Pastrnak meeting, if not exceeding (153 points remains jaw-dropping even months later), early expectations.\\nOnce through the elite up front, by all means, grab a goaltender. A good one, that plays a lot, for a better-than-average team. A standout defender, if still available, also presents as a nice acquisition - but not at the expense of a high-performing netminder - at this stage. More on those two positions below.\\nAfter your superstars and a great goalie are secured, feel free to fill out your roster with greater respect to positional need and/or categories. Loading up on attractive centers while disregarding those on either wing will limit you in adjusting your lineup throughout the season. There\\'s good reason we harbor extra fantasy love for those eligible at multiple positions. In leagues that overlook specificity of position, and classify all forwards equally (F), continue to draft the best forecast player available.\\nButton-hooking back to the value in preparation, mining team previews and other preseason content to determine who\\'s skating where, and with whom, along with schedule hacks and other useful material, can pay out significant fantasy dividends ahead of your draft and beyond. The more you know and all that.\\nTest out your strategy with the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby. Draft your team, risk free, and practice drafting today!\\nAlong with a foundation of sure-fire performers (or as close to), \"overachieving\" sleeper candidates, including those returning from long-term injuries, can help make the difference between fantasy victory and defeat. Securing a later-round gem - one that outperforms their projections - goes a long way in challenging for the ultimate crown.\\nOften a change in employ makes a significant difference in a player\\'s productivity (for better or worse). Does Ryan Johansen resurge as Colorado\\'s new second-line center after last year\\'s dismal showing in Nashville? Betcha former Bruin Taylor Hall puts up a lot more than 36 points (61 games) in Chicago alongside this young buck everyone keeps talking about named Connor Bedard. Keep an eye on our fantasy hockey space for more comprehensive sleeper coverage in the coming days.\\nFor record, potential breakout candidate Tim Stutzle headlined this segment in last fall\\'s version of \\'Play to Win\\'. The third-year center\\'s haul of 90 points through 78 games later illustrates the value in recognizing a player on the cusp of erupting, especially when placed in a ripe position and surrounded by high-tier supporting talent. In my view, Philly\\'s Owen Tippett, for one, emits this particular breakout scent ahead of 2023-24.\\n\\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\\nCreate your custom league for free!\\nOn the flip side, some players are going to regress. Skaters age, change teams/lines, or just can\\'t emulate what amounted to an atypically positive season, months earlier. What\\'s crucial here is identifying not only who presents as a candidate for regression, but by how large a margin.\\nMaybe (most probably) Erik Karlsson doesn\\'t pot 101 points for a second year running, with his new club in Pittsburgh. But would you mind a 75-80 point campaign from the veteran blueliner, while he scoots around on a top power play with Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, and (eventually) Jake Guentzel? I most definitely would not.\\nBut what about Edmonton\\'s Ryan Nugent-Hopkins or Jeff Skinner with the Sabres? A slip off Tage Thompson\\'s forward line and the latter might be hard-pressed to kick out another 35 goals and 47 assists. Johnny Gaudreau and Matt Duchene earned mentions in this space 12 months ago, and we all know how their seasons unfolded as compared to 2021-22. This isn\\'t to suggest you shouldn\\'t grab such players altogether, just temper expectations and draft them accordingly.\\nWith only a handful of performers responsible for carrying several categories, you need consistent play from between the pipes. In conventional H2H points leagues where three to four goalies are shuffled in and out of your active roster, at least one standout operator, good for 60 or so games - Igor Shesterkin, Jake Oettinger, Andrei Vasilevskiy, Juuse Saros etc. - should be included on your fantasy roster, along with a solid second-tier fantasy netminder. A Filip Gustavsson or the like. Once that one-two G1/G2 punch is secured, pad your goaltending corps with quality tandem-team members - especially those who hold the potential of running with the number one gig - and/or an outlying sleeper candidate. This year\\'s possible Ullmark, if you will.\\nNew faces in new places also deserve extra thought at this position. Could the Senators\\' fresh No. 1 Joonas Korpisalo prove to be this season\\'s Alexandar Georgiev, fantasy-wise? Or are we in for another ho-hum debut showing in Ottawa, à la Cam Talbot (now gone for Los Angeles). These are the questions that deserve a deeper dive ahead of rounding out your goaltending corps to start.\\nAgain, this position can\\'t be overlooked as such a limited group is responsible for putting up winning numbers through three, four, or more fantasy categories. Managers who strike the right balance in filling their net with the league\\'s busiest and most consistent performers, while still loading up on star skaters out front, will inevitably find themselves in the winning mix by season\\'s end. A (fun) challenge, to be sure, but nobody said this was supposed to be easy.\\nStarting your own league is easier than ever! Set your league size, select your keepers, and invite your friends to start playing. Sign up for free today be the commish!\\nNumber of league participants, roster size, and ratio of allotted positions split between forwards and defenders all plays a part in building your blue line. For instance, if your daily or weekly lineup requires more than twice as many totalled C, LW, and RW as defensemen, give the latter position a little less attention in your draft. Again, look to the cream of the heavy-hitters crop up front do their best work for you. Nearly 30 regularly-performing forwards averaged 2.4 fantasy points or more in ESPN\\'s default league in 2022-23, as compared to only seven defenders.\\nBut you still need these skaters, especially in leagues that reward blocked-shots and ATOI. There\\'s certainly merit to grabbing an elite performer - a healthy Cale Makar, Rasmus Dahlin, Roman Josi etc. - in the earlier stages of your draft, just not at the expense of a star forward or game-changing goalie. There are too many solid-enough assets available otherwise. Think Vancouver\\'s Quinn Hughes or a ready-to-rock-again Zach Werenski in Columbus.\\nIt\\'s also worth knowing that nearly 70 regular defenders averaged 1.7 points or more in our standard game. Meaning there are plenty of options - with an eye to sleeper potential - from which to choose in padding your roster in later draft rounds. No need to load up early on non-elite blueliners at all.\\nThey sure do. While the aforementioned draft strategy largely applies to conventional scoring competition, particularly ESPN\\'s default game, the inclusion of other custom categories likely necessitates a different approach. For instance, if penalty minutes count in your league, both Brady Tkachuk and Matthew Tkachuk should shoot up your pre-draft target list. Fantasy competition that rewards blocked shots means taking a fresh look at your list of coveted defenders.\\nIslander Bo Horvat, along with other centers of his drawing ilk, deserve extra attention in leagues that reward regular success in the faceoff dot. Do assists carry as much weight as goals? Food for scoring thought, no?\\nFamiliarize yourself thoroughly with your own league\\'s categories - taking into consideration whether stats count for their straight up value or for points (and how many) - and revise your rankings accordingly. Don\\'t fall over yourself to draft a banger, who doesn\\'t score as much, if hits are only each worth 0.1 points. Our preseason in-depth look into individual categories will also help in preparing you in maximizing value across the board.\\nReady to play? Sign up for free today!\\nThe type of league itself also matters a whole lot. While most ESPN managers compete in a H2H points league, there are other options, often requiring an amended approach to roster assembly and season-long management. Familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of all leagues available on ESPN.com here to figure out which best suits your own fantasy tastes.\\nDynasty and keeper competition - where patience and foresight is key - remains popular with many fantasy managers. Equipped with few draft picks each season - just like in real head-office life - dynasty managers often have to look ahead two, three, even four seasons in trying to fortify a solid foundation of talent, year in and out. There\\'s always risk in that good number of prospective stars never reach their full projected potential, but that\\'s part of the game. Securing the most promising player possible works out often enough.\\nOh, and draft Bedard straight away, if possible.\\nKeeper leagues are different in that more players are shuffled in and out each season. While you want to maintain the strongest core possible - seven, eight, or more elite players - drafting a talented, perhaps aging, temp isn\\'t necessarily a bad move. Are you in position to win in the here and now? Then go on and select the scoring veteran who\\'s going to make it happen for you right now. Just don\\'t completely disregard young emerging talent in the meanwhile (see again: Bedard). Mind you, fantasy managers with weaker, rebuilding rosters should instead solely focus on the talent of tomorrow, whether NHL active or not.\\nMoving on now, drafting a quality squad isn\\'t nearly enough. Unless participating in a set-and-forget seasonal league, keeping your finger on the pulse of which player is accomplishing what, where, and with whom, all the while keeping a keen eye on who\\'s available on the waiver wire is integral to fantasy success. Especially early on. Players fall injured, lose their scoring mojo, and/or shift up and down their respective lineups regularly enough. While the draft remains the most important three-hour stretch of your fantasy season, it\\'s still possible to make up for a handful of misguided picks through diligent roster fiddling. Many a successful manager will boast a very different-looking roster in April as compared to October.\\nWhile specific roles matter - Pavel Zacha sports a lot more fantasy sparkle in centering David Pastrnak at even-strength and on the power play than he would/has otherwise - it\\'s also important to take the bigger team picture into account. Some Calgary skaters may have a bit more pep in their scoring step under new bench boss Ryan Huska. Keep an eye on who\\'s responding best to Mike Babcock\\'s fresh presence in Columbus. Same applies to the Predators under Andrew Brunette - who\\'s already promising an inspired commitment to offense - and other clubs with new bench bosses (Rangers, Capitals, Ducks).\\nWhatever the reason, if there\\'s a more promising positional player available on the wire than on your active roster, switch them out. Not in hair-trigger fashion, mind you, but with level-headed foresight. Panicking prematurely, particularly in reaction to a players\\' slow start, will get you nowhere fast. And don\\'t disregard the number of transactions permitted throughout the season, ranging from only a handful to an unlimited amount. You won\\'t want to use up them all, or blow your entire FAAB, in the first few weeks. You want access to that roster-saving, dark-horse goaltender when they blow up sometime in February, don\\'t you?\\nAlso, bookmark this space. ESPN\\'s NHL fantasy department rolls out helpful material almost daily, designed to optimize your chances of victory. Even one roster substitute could mean the difference between winning and losing that particular week.\\nUse those roster slots to your full advantage, even ahead of season\\'s launch. Don\\'t shy away from drafting Florida defenseman Brandon Montour, for example, just because he\\'s expected to miss a handful of games following offseason shoulder surgery. Not after last season\\'s 73-point campaign, including 33 scored with the extra skater. Jam him, or any other not-quite-healthy fantasy asset you fancy, in one of your IR spots and give it a minute.\\nBroker \\'em. Especially if waiver wire pickings are lean. Your roster probably isn\\'t perfect, which means another active manager is also dealing with weakness at some position or another. The act of reciprocal back-scratching can prove win-win for both of you, which is a-okay. Focus on the larger task of beating the field. Contrary to how some fantasy sport participants comport themselves, forging a successful trade is not about undressing another manager. The ultimate deal benefits both sides, at least to some degree, in filling a respective void. Your coveted winger for my competent (yet still somewhat disposable) goalie. An exchange of elderly (but still trucking) stars for up-and-comers in keeper leagues, depending on who\\'s rebuilding and who\\'s on the cusp of winning it all. Remember there\\'s a large difference between being competitive and unnecessarily cutthroat.\\nIf you\\'ve made it this far, take the next step and sign up for ESPN Fantasy hockey.

       " 'MLS\\nOn Saturday, moments after Inter Miami’s 2-0 win over the New York Red Bulls, the dozens of reporters who were at Red Bull Arena to cover Lionel Messi’s MLS debut descended into the depths of the stadium to perform their usual post-game duties. Both head coaches gave press conferences. Players from both teams spoke about what transpired during the match.\\nAdvertisement\\nThere was no shortage of storylines. Messi, still the biggest player in global football and the most famous player MLS has ever seen, had created Miami’s second goal seemingly out of thin air. What had he seen? How had he navigated that sea of opponents? What had he made of the atmosphere and the level of play?\\nSome reporters wanted answers to those questions and more on Saturday, but they never came. Messi did not talk to the media after the match, despite the protests of a few reporters, most notably Ron Blum from the Associated Press, which published an update solely about Messi’s lack of availability.\\nMLS has a long-standing media policy, meant to ensure that its players are available to journalists at every match and training session. The Associated Press wrote on Saturday that it had received prior assurance that Messi, like many high-profile players before him, would be subject to that same policy. The league is now characterizing that differently.\\n“There was a misunderstanding regarding Lionel Messi’s media access,” a league spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday. “He has not violated any guidelines for his media availability in Major League Soccer.”\\nWhen reached on Tuesday, the AP said it stood by its reporting but declined to comment further on the record.\\nMessi did not speak to reporters after Miami’s draw against Nashville on Wednesday evening. Outside of a few brief remarks made to Apple TV after his debut in Leagues Cup, he has never done any post-game media during his time in the United States. Off the pitch, the Argentine has only done a single press conference and a trio of short interviews with a selection of outlets.\\nThis is not entirely unexpected. Messi has always been a fairly private person, only granting interviews to trusted reporters in Argentina and Spain, where he has spent the bulk of his life. At the tail end of a storied career and with millions of followers on his own carefully curated social media channels, he has little personal motivation to speak to reporters.\\nAdvertisement\\nIn the United States, though, players and coaches across most major sports are required to speak with the media after games or other events. Fans depend on that access to stay current and media outlets depend on it to accurately convey those events. Even this country’s biggest stars — international figures like LeBron James, Tom Brady or Michael Jordan — have almost always given post-game interviews and done press conferences.\\nThat’s simply not the case in other countries, where access is much more limited. And that’s to say nothing of the uniquely American tradition of opening a club’s locker room to reporters after a match, creating an environment where media have relatively unfettered access to any player they want mere moments after their greatest athletic triumphs — or failures.\\nAs MLS has evolved, the rights the league affords to media have sometimes eroded, with clubs regularly skirting the league’s access policies with little to no consequence. Messi’s presence has given MLS a massive dose of much-needed publicity and attention, often from the types of outlets that rarely give space to the league, or even to soccer in general. It has also resulted in growing pains, and the exacerbation of issues that predated the Argentine’s arrival entirely.\\nIt’s worth laying out what, exactly, MLS’ media guidelines are.\\nAt games, MLS clubs are required to provide open access to locker rooms starting 15 minutes after the final whistle. During that period, media enter the locker room and conduct interviews with the players of their choosing. The head coaches from both teams have their own requirements — they give a press conference, which will sometimes also include noteworthy players.\\nIn theory, players are also required to be available for a window in the 90 minutes leading up to a match – something reporters rarely, if ever, take advantage of. Training sessions throughout the week have their own guidelines — “all practice sessions will have a minimum 15 minute ‘open’ window during practice,” read the league’s media guidelines, for filming and content capture. Clubs are also required to make “all players and coaches” available for 15 minutes before or after any given training session.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe Athletic has obtained a copy of the 2016 version of the policy, embedded below:\\n\\nThese guidelines were updated in 2017 to encourage more forward-thinking broadcast coverage, like “mic’ing up” players and coaches and placing cameras in locker rooms or in team talks. The league says it worked with players, broadcast partners, club staff and the Major League Soccer Players Association to help craft those guidelines. A league source said this week that MLS is once again in the process of revising its media policies.\\nTechnically, every player in the league is subject to the media guidelines, Messi included. Yet the idea that a man who many call the greatest player in the history of football would answer questions from reporters after every match, or training session — or in the hours leading up to a match, even — has always seemed a little farcical when he has never been asked to do any of that before.\\nIndeed, Messi and his representation have their own arrangement with the league and Inter Miami, though it remains unclear exactly what that entails. On Tuesday, a league source said the entire arrangement is very much a work in progress. Another source, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, characterized Messi’s obligations as “a handshake sort of deal” where the player simply pledged to do the media he chooses to, when he chooses to. Inter Miami could not be reached for comment.\\nMLS has had its share of international megastars during its 28-year history. David Beckham, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Wayne Rooney and a host of others have featured in the league, and they have all handled media in their own way.\\nFew fully adhered to the league’s official media policies, but some were shockingly accessible given their profile. During his time with the Red Bulls, French legend Thierry Henry was regularly available post-game, sometimes doing media scrums in a weight room at Red Bull Arena adjacent to the locker room. Rooney met with reporters at his locker after nearly every match he played in MLS, with few exceptions. He remains available, for the most part, as a head coach of D.C. United. He has regularly used his platform to push MLS to reform any number of issues: travel accommodations, officiating and the like.\\n“In England, you speak to the press after a game, they have a different way of handling it,” Rooney told The Athletic in 2019, “because you know if you don’t do well, they’ll try and angle to get you to say something, maybe, about your teammate or something. Over here I feel that the questions are more honest questions and I feel you get a more honest answer with them.”\\nAdvertisement\\nNone of these players, though, were available to every credentialed media member on any given day, as the league’s policy requires. Many of the league’s higher-profile players have far busier schedules than their teammates: media appearances, commercial obligations and the like. Others simply have the leverage to ignore the league’s media policies en masse.\\nThe league and its clubs have at times endeavored to educate big-name players on the media environment they’re entering when they sign an MLS contract. In Orlando, the club showed Kaka, among the biggest-name players to have ever played in the United States, videos of LeBron James speaking to media in order to land that point. Didier Drogba was open with media during his time in Montreal (and later in Arizona, in the USL) in part because the league does its best to set expectations.\\nOther players, though, have struggled to adapt.\\n“They freak out about it,” MLS commissioner Don Garber told reporters in 2016, a year before the league revised its media policies. “We needed to get our owners to say, ‘You’re here now, you’re making a lot of money, more money than they’d make overseas,’ and they have to understand that the media needs the information that you can give them while they’re covering the match.”\\nMaybe the most direct analog to Lionel Messi is David Beckham, the English legend who joined the LA Galaxy in 2007 and now co-owns the team Messi plays on. Beckham was a global celebrity before he touched down in MLS, and his arrival in LA massively amplified the media presence of the league and the Galaxy. He gave many interviews during his time in the United States and was generally available after every match the Galaxy played — and often after training sessions. His profile, like Messi’s, largely eliminated the possibility of media speaking to him in front of his locker, but he typically spoke with reporters during the club’s post-game press conference, which would likely be the setting best-suited to Messi, if he ever chooses to talk to reporters after a match.\\nThat said. Messi’s footprint dwarfs Beckham’s, and he has arrived with different goals. Beckham was very much the latest in a line of soccer emissaries – players who came to the United States not only for the payday and the competition but also to “grow the game.” Maybe Beckham, like Pelé before him, felt more of a compulsion or obligation to interact with media as part of that responsibility.\\nMessi does not feel that sense of obligation. In his only American press conference to date, the Argentine was asked by The Athletic’s Felipe Cárdenas what he thinks of that perception, that he is the latest in a line of players brought to the United States to bring soccer more firmly into the mainstream.\\nAdvertisement\\n“My decision to come here happened for many reasons,” said Messi. “…But honestly I don’t think of all of that. I simply came here to play, to continue enjoying football, which is what I’ve liked my entire life. And I chose this place in this moment for that, over all things.”\\nIn MLS, the open locker room is no longer the norm despite it still being part of the policy. Many clubs have instead chosen to bring select players out into a “mixed zone” outside the locker room, or in a conference room. Clubs also regularly decline to make players available post-match and players sometimes leave before the league’s designated period for post-game availability is over.\\nThe league adjusted its policies during COVID-19, replacing its in-person opportunities with teleconferences. In May of 2021, MLS went back to its open locker room policy; in an email to club officials, the league made it clear that there should be “no exceptions.” Earlier this week, a source involved in the conversations surrounding the league’s current and future policies stated that the league has “no intention” of doing away with the open locker room.\\nNot everyone is happy about that. Some clubs have jostled with the league over locker room access, said multiple sources involved in those conversations, doing their best to abandon the open-locker-room policy altogether. But by and large, the league is keen to keep its access policies in line with the four major leagues in America: The NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL. Messi aside, MLS is still working towards national and international relevance and still needs all the coverage it can get. Restricting media access would seem counterproductive.\\nIn many cases, speaking to a player outside of the locker room works fine, and to an outsider, the idea of speaking to players in such an intimate setting might feel bizarre. But players and journalists alike have often appreciated the more personal approach. And in an era where so much content can feel carefully manicured and sterilized, the act of speaking to an athlete just moments after they leave the field can be transformative for a story. Players, too, sometimes use personal interactions with journalists in the changing room to offer insight or commentary in a one-on-one setting that they wouldn’t in a mixed zone in front of dozens of reporters, many of whom they don’t have any prior relationship with.\\nBut regardless of what happens with that policy, it’s likely that exceptions will continue.\\n(Top photo: CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images)\\nGet all-access to exclusive stories.\\nSubscribe to The Athletic for in-depth coverage of your favorite players, teams, leagues and clubs.

       " \"It is just four months since Wales lost 264 caps’ worth of Test experience in a single day and yet, somehow, they have overcome that disastrous preparation to become the first team to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup.\\nWarren Gatland’s magic touch seemed absent on his return as Wales coach during a disastrous Six Nations campaign marred by strike threats, a record defeat by Scotland and a regional game on the brink of collapse. When Alun Wyn Jones and Justin Tipuric then retired on the same day midway through the World Cup buildup, it seemed that Welsh rugby was staring into the abyss.\\nBut Gatland has shown that when it comes to World Cups, no one is better at getting a team up to speed – not even Eddie Jones, whose Australia side Wales thumped 40-6 in Lyon to all but end the Wallabies’ hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. Despite the prospect of a first group stage exit for Australia, Jones maintains the backing of his players, but it is nothing compared to the unyielding loyalty shown to Gatland after another miraculous turnaround\\nGareth Davies, the scrum-half, is one of those who has been a beneficiary of the 60-year-old’s return, re-establishing himself as first choice in the No 9 jersey. He scored the opening try in Lyon after three minutes and after the game explained how Gatland has revitalised the side.\\n“We had lots of changes, coaches, and that’s just made a difference. We are all back to where we want to be because of this management,” Davies said. “We are fighting for each other, playing for each other and the environment is good. We’re enjoying our time off the pitch, it’s a good bunch of boys here. It shows on the pitch.\\n“Warren has just got his way and it works for me and it obviously works for everyone else in the squad.”\\nIt is not just the players who have appreciated Gatland’s return, with the forwards coach, Jonathan Humphreys, having worked under both the New Zealander and his predecessor Wayne Pivac. Humphreys said: “He’s just taken us back to the DNA of this team: be fit, work hard. That’s what everybody hangs their hat on; we believe that we work harder than anybody else and that’s a powerful tool. We’re becoming a very tough team to beat.”\\nWhile Gatland’s Wales can now start to dream of a third semi-final in four World Cup campaigns, Australia and Eddie Jones are relying on a favour from both Georgia and Portugal if their own stay in France is to be extended. With a report that Jones had interviewed for the Japan national team job weeks before the World Cup appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald on the day of the crucial match against Wales, the heat is very much on the former England coach.\\nBut despite that, his players say Jones is still the man to lead the side over a crucial four-year period for Australian rugby, with a Lions tour in 2025 followed by hosting the World Cup two years later.\\nWill Skelton, the Wallabies captain, has missed the last two games, losses to Fiji and Wales, through injury. But he says Jones has the vision to turn things around. “We have full trust in him. He’s got the full support of the group.\\nI think his long-term vision and what he wants Australian rugby to be back to, I think that’s a positive.\\nSign up to The Breakdown\\nThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed\\nafter newsletter promotion\\n“The way he is around the group, you see in the media he has his persona but when you see him one-to-one, in front of the team, how he speaks, how he directs, the boys follow him, and I do as well.\\n“He is a fantastic coach with a massive rugby IQ. We’re learning every day when we’re working with him. It’s one of those things, he simplifies the game for us.”\\nAt 31, Skelton is aware that he may not be back on this stage in four years’ time but, crucially, Jones has also received the support of some of the young core of the Wallabies squad, starting with standout loosehead prop Angus Bell, 22. “Eddie’s our coach, what he’s done with our team already has been awesome. This performance wasn’t good enough but that’s on the players, that’s on us.”\\nWhere Australia’s players were keen to share some of the responsibility for their meek displays in France, the overriding response from the Welsh contingent was to credit Gatland for Wales’s renaissance. Given their transformation, you can see why.\\n\",\n",
       " 'MLS\\nIn 2015, MLS commissioner Don Garber made headlines across the pond by suggesting the league he runs is more competitive than the Premier League. His reasoning: That while just a handful of teams in the Premier League can realistically win the title in any given season, just about every team in MLS begins the season believing they have a chance of winning MLS Cup.\\nAdvertisement\\n“We see some of the challenges of competing in the Premier League,” he said at a Soccerex conference in Manchester. “We have wealthy owners, but we are very committed to the idea that at the start of every season, every fan can think their team can win a championship. We want someone in Kansas City, even though they are smaller than New York City, to think they can win the title.”\\nSince 2012, there have been five winners of the Premier League: Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Leicester City and Manchester United. In Spain’s La Liga, there have been three winners in the same span; in France, PSG has dominated the past decade, winning eight of the last 10 league titles; in Italy, Juventus won nine in a row during the 2010s and in the Bundesliga, the least “competitive” of Europe’s top five leagues at the top end, Bayern Munich have swept every league title since 2013.\\nBy contrast, it’s extremely difficult to repeat as champion in MLS, even once. The 2023 regular season performance of last year’s MLS Cup finalists LAFC and Philadelphia Union, who meet this weekend in league play, proves as much.\\nGO DEEPER\\nKroenkes in dispute with FIFA over SoFi Stadium deal for 2026 World Cup\\nSince a team last had repeat success, there have been nine MLS Cup winners. LAFC collected both the Supporters’ Shield (given to the team with the best regular season record) and MLS Cup in 2022, but this year it’s St. Louis City, playing their first season in MLS, that is leading the Western Conference despite many pundits (including most of The Athletic’s writers) predicting they would finish dead last.\\nFor better or worse, it’s by design: MLS is supposed to have an equal playing field. The league sits in the awkward position of aspiring to grow while also making the most of its place in the food chain. When a side wins MLS Cup, for example, they will now almost invariably inevitably spend the winter preparing for bids for their best talent from abroad, and often from Europe’s top five leagues.\\n\\nAfter their MLS Cup triumph in 2018, Atlanta United sold star forward Miguel Almiron to Newcastle United in the Premier League, and while they responded with a solid year – finishing second in the Eastern Conference and the semifinals of the playoffs – they have failed to qualify for the postseason in two out of the three seasons since.\\nAdvertisement\\nMore recently, after New York City’s title-winning season in 2021, Valentin “Taty” Castellanos departed for La Liga with Girona. After their 2022 triumph, LAFC has since lost Gareth Bale to retirement, top goalscorer Cristian “Chicho” Arango to Liga MX (only later to return to MLS with Real Salt Lake) and Jose Cifuentes, an important cog of the title-winning midfield, to Rangers in the Scottish Premiership. MLS clubs will naturally find it very challenging to create dynasties if it is more financially viable for them to sell their best players – though in most cases, the clubs do not even receive the full transfer fee.\\n“We want to develop young players, have them be successful here and then move them on,” Houston Dynamo general manager Pat Onstad told The Athletic. “I think when you do that, everybody in the club benefits. Not just ownership or our salary cap but the players training with that player. When I was in Columbus, and Zack Steffen moved on to Manchester City, the guys in that locker room felt honored to play with the guy that went on to play a bit in the Premier League and now the Championship. I think everybody’s desire is to play in a top-five league, so that’s something we’d like to do.”\\nGO DEEPER\\nAtlanta celebrates its incoming, generational status as a U.S. Soccer hub\\nThat’s not to say LAFC has struggled mightily since winning the title last year. No club has posted a more impressive start to the season in over a decade, and only the 2020 Seattle Sounders can match LAFC’s 28 points through the opening 15 games of the regular season. LAFC’s issues have surfaced later on in the year, with performances dropping significantly following their CONCACAF Champions League final defeat to Club Leon.\\nIf you ask LAFC manager Steve Cherundolo, the straightforward reason for his side struggling to maintain that electric early season form is the inability of smaller MLS rosters, limited to 20 senior players along with up to 10 supplemental players (usually draft picks, homegrown products, and other young or developing prospects) to cope with the schedule that qualifying for continental competition brings. By the end of this season, with a deep playoff run, LAFC could have played close to 60 games.\\n“In tournaments like this, if you want to consistently compete in finals and win them, you have to rethink your roster rules and regulations,” Cherundolo said after losing the two-legged Champions League final 3-1 on aggregate.\\nAdvertisement\\n“We are at a big disadvantage… money in this game buys quality players. We have a good enough team to win this tournament, but with our scheduling and all of the competitions this year, we had a lot going on. We ended up in the final not at our best moment. Roster building is about that. Having deeper rosters, more players, and more quality players on your team will allow you to extend those periods of play. Every MLS team is at a disadvantage now.”\\nFor the 2023 season, the MLS salary cap is $5.2 million per team, excluding designated players and allocation money that can be used to buy down players’ cap hits. These constraints were once essential to ensure the league remained financially secure. But with clubs like LAFC, Toronto FC and Inter Miami, who have signed Lionel Messi to a monster deal worth over $50 million annually, demonstrating they have the ambition to build rosters with the capabilities to compete consistently in MLS and continental competition, Cherundolo argues the league is directly hurting its team’s chances of success.\\nLast year, for example, the Seattle Sounders became the first club to win CONCACAF’s premier club competition since 2000. Subsequently, they collapsed to a historically poor 11th-placed finish in the West, the first time the club failed to qualify for the playoffs since joining MLS. It is not the first time a team has experienced success in a continental club competition and was unable to replicate it in the league, but the persistent underperformance for American clubs (who arguably possess more star quality than their Liga MX counterparts) after MLS Cup success is at least partly influenced by the league’s restrictions on building a roster with strength in depth.\\nDespite losing their primary goalscorer and Bale, whose primary contribution came in the MLS Cup final, LAFC has retained the core of their squad while using the summer transfer window to strengthen their team with versatile players capable of contributing in several positions. As defending champions in this iteration of MLS go, they are about as well placed as possible to fight deep into the playoffs. Well, about as well-placed as you can be in a format that relies on hitting form at precisely the right time.\\nBut a front office should not have to prioritize jack-of-all-trades to compete for silverware. Messi’s arrival brings millions of eyeballs worldwide to a league desperate for coverage in a saturated U.S. sports market. Competitiveness is great within reason, but it should not hinder the franchises that aspire for sustained success.\\n(Photo: Rob Ericson/ISI Photos/Getty Images)\\nGet all-access to exclusive stories.\\nSubscribe to The Athletic for in-depth coverage of your favorite players, teams, leagues and clubs.

       " \"Eddie Jones’s Australia are on the brink of group-stage elimination for the first time after little went right for his team in Lyon\\nIt occurred around the 26th minute mark. David Porecki, the latest Australian to have the captaincy thrust upon him by Eddie Jones, had the ball in his hand eight metres from the Welsh try line. A Test level hooker, he was about to perform his primary function and throw to the line-out. Surely he’d practiced this a thousand times this past week in preparation for one of the most important matches in Wallabies history. Surely he was in complete synchronicity with his jumpers. Surely Australian rugby wasn’t so shambolic.\\nInstead the ball sailed harmlessly over the top. It landed in the bread basket of Jac Morgan, Wales’ captain who sported wads of tissue up two bloodied nostrils and wore a crazed look all night like a character from a Tarantino film. Morgan kicked down field and won a 50-22. Australia coughed up a penalty. Gareth Anscombe teed up and slotted three points for a 13-6 lead.\\nThis was the beginning of the end. A butterfly’s wing beat gained momentum and, by the full time whistle, left Australian rugby and the poor saps tasked with representing it in pieces. There have been bigger losses but surely this must rank as the worst of them all. It means Fiji need only five points from their matches against Georgia and Portugal to dump Australia out of the World Cup before the knockouts.\\nThere were other moments that similarly used as compelling case studies for the visceral decline of a code that now looks bereft of ideas, leadership or inspiration. On 34 minutes Australia were building through the phases. It felt like the Australia of old. Tate McDermott at scrum-half, one of the few bright lights in an otherwise bleakly dark show, was zipping passes left and right. Runners off the shoulder. Aggression at the ruck. Remember the good ol’ days? Then Samu Kerevi spiralled a pass straight into touch. Oh. So this is how it’s going to be from now on?\\nFour minutes later Rob Valetini spotted that the ball was free at the back of the Welsh ruck. But rather than pick it up as he was entitled to do, he lost his head and his feet and dived straight over it, gifting Anscombe another shot at goal which he duly slotted.\\nAfter the restart to kick off the second half, Richie Arnold leaped high to gather the ball but he lacked the requisite support and was tied up by the hungrier Welsh backs. When Porecki lost his radar and delivered a skew line-out five minutes down the road, Wales won another scrum penalty, giving Gareth Davies the licence to hoof a speculative kick that ended in a 50-22. From the resulting line-out in Australian territory, they went through the phases and Anscombe dinked a ball for the onrushing Nick Tompkins to dot down. Where the fullback Andrew Kellaway was in all this remains a mystery.\\nEvery time something worked, something else would break down. It all felt completely random at times. Surely a knock-on in the back field isn’t connected to a misfiring scrum? Is Ben Donaldson’s restart that sailed straight into touch a symptom of Australia’s poor discipline at the breakdown? Of course it is. It’s all connected. And the man in the middle must surely cop the most blame.\\nHours before the start of this match, it was reported that Eddie Jones had held a secret Zoom meeting for a potential job elsewhere just days before the World Cup. Is this a sign that his heart was never really in it? Has the pantomime villainy and combative press conferences been nothing but a ruse? Is he a puppeteer pulling strings we can’t see or is he just a man out of luck and out of ideas? After this sorry display the answer seems obvious.\\nSign up to The Breakdown\\nThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed\\nafter newsletter promotion\\nOne wonders where Australian rugby goes from here. Fans back home will be waking up feeling embarrassed and ashamed. Their anger cannot be ignored. Jones, to his credit, at least acknowledged that the ire of the supporters is valid. The same can’t be said of Rugby Australia’s chairman, Hamish McLennan, who told disgruntled supporters, “if you don’t like it, don’t watch”. This is up there with “let them eat cake” in terms of callous dismissiveness. If McLennan isn’t careful, he may alienate his entire base before long.\\nWhen Carter Gordan, a young man treated like a rag doll because of poor management above him, missed his penalty touch finder near the end of the match, thereby handing possession back to Wales, throngs of fans in gold made their way to the exit. It’s a mission getting from Lyon’s city centre to the stadium and it’s a long way to go for only a portion of a rugby match. But they’d seen enough. This might not be rock bottom but Australian rugby has dug through a layer of earth that had never been plumbed before. How much deeper can it go before there’s no one left to haul it back out?\\n\"]"

       "[\"author: james colgan date: september 23, 2023 publication: golf.com/news  lexi thompson's solheim cup shank wasn't the talk of the golf world on saturday — but her response to it was. getty images casares, spain — early in my golf.com career, i caught a devastating case of the shanks. it was fall 2021 and i was in southern california for a video series based around a swing lesson from legendary swing coach dave phillips. we hired a videographer and flew in our photographer and two fellow writers for the occasion, taking over the hulking titleist performance institute for a few hours. (the other attendees won’t be named for purposes of protecting the innocent.) after a few minutes of polite conversation, we turned the cameras on and started swinging — which was also the moment i realized i was in for the worst hour of my life. i felt like i swung the club the same way i had for the previous six months of my life, but the result was decidedly not anything i was used to seeing. instead of my typical gentle hook, i found the most consistent — and deeply horrifying — result of my golfing life: a 70-yard hosel-rocket. the cameras rolled on my disaster for about 30 minutes. my face turned a new shade of magenta. my entire body tensed with dread. my coworkers begged me to figure it out. it was no use. phillips, a brilliant swing coach whose clientele includes jon rahm, was speechless. i could feel him wince with every shot. i remember hitting 50ish consecutive shanks that day before we finally called the whole thing off — though it’s hard to say how my brain’s trauma response affected my memory of the ordeal. just writing about it makes me want to vomit. i volunteer this memory to remind us all — myself included — that shanks are human. of golf’s many shin-kicks, none feel more painful than the hosel-adjacent miss, and yet nobody is capable of avoiding them entirely. tiger dealt with ’em, jack dealt with ’em, you deal with ’em and i most certainly deal with ’em, too. hitting a shank is like stubbing your toe — you just hope when it happens you’re somewhere private enough to shed a tear.       on friday evening at the solheim cup, lexi thompson experienced a painful reminder of this truth. on the 18th green of her second match of the day, a bruising fourball battle with leona maguire and georgia hall, thompson faced a tricky chip shot from a sidehill lie and shanked it. it was likely the most pivotal moment of the tournament to that point — the third shot in a tied match with thompson needing birdie to keep the americans alive. it ended in disaster. oh no lexi thompson #solheimcup2023 pic.twitter.com/pqedimdbjo in the immediate aftermath of the shank, the u.s. side offered an exemplary look at how one should respond to such a public disappointment. thompson nearly holed her next shot, a brilliant chip from just off the putting surface, then graciously congratulated both of her opponents on a match well won. off to the side of the green, her teammates quickly rallied to her defense, offering concerned looks and later, genuine consolation. megan khang, the 5-foot-nothing soul of this u.s. squad, even found herself working crowd control. “now that’s just rude,” she said, whipping around to chide a snickering euro fan, who quickly shut his mouth. but the feel-good story only lasted the better part of an hour, until thompson found herself sitting in the u.s. team’s friday evening press conference. after fielding a series of softball questions about the quality of her play throughout the day (which, to her credit, had been largely tremendous) and the difficulty of walking 36 holes, sports illustrated reporter alex miceli was handed the microphone. finally, he posed the question everyone wanted to hear. “lexi, could you talk about that third shot on 18?” miceli asked. “there was some question on what you were trying to do and what you actually did do on the third shot. could you just go through it for us?” thompson didn’t. “i don’t need to comment on that.” “excuse me?” miceli said. “i don’t need to comment on the chip,” she said again, holding her gaze. “it was a bad lie, and i didn’t hit a good chip, but it was pretty much impossible, so…” quickly, a member of the lpga’s communications staff swooped in to redirect the conversation, but not before u.s. team captain stacy lewis delivered a snipe of her own. “that’s a terrible question,” lewis said. the press conference continued as usual after that moment, but the damage had already been done. suddenly, the shank was awkward. confounding answer from lexi and subsequent reaction from the us side. it was one of the pivotal moments of the entire day and somehow that's off limits? pic.twitter.com/9std3lflmn  by the time morning broke on saturday in spain, thompson’s response was the talk of the golf internet. social media accounts tied to various members of golf media quickly rallied to miceli’s defense, criticizing thompson and lewis for their response to what they saw as a fair and understandable question. others watching from home, including thompson’s former solheim cup teammate jess korda, saw the situation differently. “so sad seeing golf media, yet again, shred lexi,” korda tweeted. “it’s easy writing about other people’s mistakes. it’s golf, bad shots happen — give the girl a break. she grows the game more than anyone on tour… and she’s a great player!!” this isn’t the first time this critique has been surfaced from members of the women’s game — that golf media spends too much time preying on the failures of women’s golf — and we’ve heard it before specifically in regard to thompson, whose career has been marked by major championship heartbreak on a handful of different occasions. that is a complex issue, and one always worth considering. but the truth of this situation is actually far simpler than matters of gender or media bias. the truth is that the persisting awkwardness surrounding the shank exists exclusively because of lexi’s approach to answering the question. yes, it would be every bit fair if she entered that press conference upset about the shot, and it is every bit her right to decline to answer any question she’s asked. it is also every bit her captain’s prerogative to feel protective over her players. it’s also fair to point out that bedside manner is important when asking these questions, and while i might not have found any issue with the miceli’s forthrightness, thompson and lewis might have. in any case, though, korda’s right. it’s golf, and bad shots happen all the time. i’m more than willing to give lexi a break for hitting an ill-timed shank, as i’m sure the overwhelming majority of golf media is. but it’s important to note that the reason the shank became a talking point (rather than just a relatable mistake in a high-pressure situation) didn’t stem from golf media’s ability to give lexi a break. it came from her response! miceli wasn’t acting maliciously; he was doing his job, which at the most basic level is to serve as a proxy for the fan. any fan watching the solheim cup on friday evening wanted to know what happened with lexi’s chip, and it would be no less than professional malpractice for those in the room not to ask. thompson knows this, and so does lewis. no athlete survives for more than 15 minutes in the public eye without learning the burden of scrutiny that comes with the job. some face more scrutiny than others and some handle that weight better than others, but no one is afforded the freedom to avoid it entirely. without scrutiny (and the fandom, investment and commerce it engenders), there is no professional golf in its current form (nor with its current purses). i’m sure that further down the line, lexi and lewis will both admit miceli’s question caught them in a tense, disappointed moment. that their response wasn’t a reflection of their true feelings about the question, but rather the adrenaline of a high-pressure weekend. but for now we only have that moment — and the resulting response. it’s easy to understand why this issue turned into a landmine. women’s golf is underfunded, under-supported and underexposed relative to their male counterparts, which makes the media attention the sport receives significantly more impactful to its success. good press is good for business, but not all press is good press. in a social media world where misogynistic comments can run unchecked, it’s hardly difficult to get why some female athletes would take negative coverage personally, or why many of them wish for advocacy from golf media. the funny thing is, the vast majority of female pros deserve to be advocated for. on the whole they are more generous with their time, happier to accept accountability for their failures and less fearful of vulnerability than their male counterparts. these are the traits that turn ordinary golfers into role models and fan favorites, and those traits are undoubtedly responsible for some of the gains the women’s game has seen over the last decade. in this era of media distrust, it’s easy to forget the many ways in which media coverage can benefit those being covered. that doesn’t mean the media will always be beneficial, but it sure doesn’t mean they’re inherently corrupt and bad. those people are often people like me — i’m writing this no more than 20 feet from the solheim cup podium — and lord knows i know a thing or two about the shanks. soon this episode will be but a footnote to an otherwise thrilling solheim cup script, a development i’m sure will be welcomed by all parties involved. and when sunday’s singles matches were announced, thompson’s name came in the final match of the day, where she’ll face off against emily pedersen. as a result, she’ll be a large part of answering the weekend’s biggest question: who hoists the cup. james colgan is a news and features editor at golf, writing stories for the website and magazine. he

       " 'author: nick piastowski date: september 22, 2023 publication: golf.com/news  fred couples last month at the boeing classic. getty images fred couples, one of the more vocal critics of liv golf, says he’s unsure what the league’s still-to-be-determined future could mean for pro golf.  in an interview this week on cnbc’s closing bell — which you can watch here — the popular pro and 1992 masters winner also explained why he’s attacked the saudi-backed tour over the past year. but couples also wondered about liv, in light of a recently proposed coming together between its backer, saudi arabia’s public investment fund, and the pga tour.         would liv remain, following a year-plus fight with the tour? that is still to be decided, at least publicly. an agreement between the sides says only “a full and objective empirical data-driven evaluation of liv and its prospects and potential” would be undertaken, and in the time since the proposal was announced, tour officials have mostly stuck to that line. but should liv fold, there’s also the question of its players, many of whom left the tour for large, guaranteed contracts and were subsequently punished by their former series for exiting. there, the agreement says “pif, the pga tour and the dp world tour will work cooperatively and in good faith to establish a fair and objective process for any players who desire to re-apply for membership with the pga tour or the dp world tour following the completion of the 2023 season,” and tour officials have also been mum on what that process could look like. couples, though, is curious.  for clarity, here is the exchange he had with host scott wapner.  “do you hope it [the proposed agreement] doesn’t happen?” wapner asked.  “i never thought it [liv golf] would happen,” couples said. “i never thought they would get off the ground, but i guess when you have — i’m not even smart enough to figure out how many billions — you can get people to follow the money. i don’t know if it’s going to go away. again, scott, that’s another great question.  “i’m so old that i don’t — i pay attention to every golfer that plays on the pga tour, but if it goes away, is that going to be good? i don’t know if that’s going to be good or not. can we intertwine? i’m not smart enough to figure that out. i’m sure they will try and do something.” at this point in the cnbc interview, couples noted brooks koepka, a liv player who’s playing next week in the ryder cup, where couples will be a vice-captain.  “but we do have brooks koepka on the ryder cup team — he’s not really a pga tour player and every player on that team wanted him, so we still have some nice feelings about the liv guys,” couples said on cnbc. “but would i want to see it go away? it doesn’t matter to me really anymore if — their tour is set, they have their 48 guys, i don’t think any new guys have joined in five or six months, so it is what it is.”    the cnbc comments follow a flurry of thoughts from couples on liv. there were his thoughts last june to golf’s alan bastable, with a headline entitled “‘i’m done with it:’ fred couples dismisses liv golf, phil mickelson.” about a month later, there was more from couples, with golf’s headline on those comments reading “‘i’m glad they’re gone’: fred couples’ latest liv roast targets tour critics, greg norman.” and about a month later, there was more still, with this golf headline saying, “fred couples’ liv attack continues with thought on … birthdays and weddings.”   but why the barrage at all?  over the past year, couples has explained that, and on closing bell, couples explained again, though here he was reflective. for clarity again, here is the complete exchange, started by wapner.   “i don’t think it’s news to anybody you’ve been one of the most popular players on tour for an awfully long time, well before you even won the masters in ’92. so when you speak, people listen to what you have to say, and you’ve been one of the most outspoken players, i think, about the liv tour and the future of that relationship with the pga tour. i’m wondering: what was your first reaction when you heard of this potential deal between liv and the pga tour?” “you know, what a question,” couples started. “and i’ve answered it the same every single time. it affects the pga tour immensely. but really what affected me is how these guys leaving — not all of them; some of them; i shouldn’t even say five of them — were talking about the pga tour, how bad of a tour it was, how wrong it was, how they’re better off playing in the liv tour. i’ve spent — this is my 43rd year on the pga tour. i represent it the best i can. i’ve played a long time. the champions tour, scott, as you know, is great.         “but it just offended me that — go play your golf, go play in your 54-hole events — we all know that’s funny to talk about. and sometimes i felt bad about what i said. but you know when i talked to other people, i really don’t think i said anything horrific — i just reacted to what some of the guys that left said. brooks koepka, dustin johnson — i don’t talk to dustin that much, but brooks, i’ve kept in touch since this ryder cup thing, [and] we laugh every other day about stuff. and i have no qualms with 99 percent of the guys. it affects the tour. i’m no longer on that tour, but what affected me is just the things they had to say.”',\n",

[laughs.] not that into school. i mean, i guess i enjoyed school, but i wasn’t into the academic side. i really loved golf. i’d come home from school, my dad would take me to the range, and that’s all i wanted to do. dd: did you play other sports? tf: only for school. i’d play all the school sports: football, cricket, hockey — that’s field hockey for you. but, honestly, i was a distinctly very, very average athlete. dd: really? you must have good hand-eye coordination. tf: eh, i dunno. dd: ping-pong? darts? cornhole? tf: i guess i’m actually not too bad at cornhole. definitely better at that than darts. i like the extra weight. dd: the open course, hoylake, aka royal liverpool — did you play there growing up? tf: one of my close friends was a member, so we played it, like, once or twice a year. i know the course well enough to walk ’round it. do i know the intricacies of it? no. plus, we would always play it in winter conditions, very soft and stuff. but it was my first open, hoylake in 2014, so it’ll be a home venue like it was at royal lytham. it’ll be very cool going back there. dd: you were 23 in 2014. you’re 32 now. what do you remember of that first open? tf: how nervous i was going to the first tee. and then i didn’t play very well. but, seriously, i just remember how nervous i was playing my first open. dd: who are the folks on team tommy? tf: well, i’ve got fino [gestures in the direction of caddie ian finnis]. he’s a staple. and phil kenyon, who i work with on putting. [short-game coach] graham walker. and i’ve been working a bit more closely with [swing coach] butch harmon and [mental coach] bob rotella this year. they’ve been helping me out. there’s my trainer, kolby tullier. and, obviously, my wife and manager, clare. dd: that’s a star-studded group. so, to connect those ideas, how has your tournament prep changed from, say, your first open? tf: i think you’re always learning how to prepare best. i think you’re always learning about your game. and you understand how little your play in practice relates to your play when you take off on thursday — just as long as you’re ready. so i think there’s a lot more emphasis on being ready than anything else. i still love preparing for golf tournaments. i enjoy these days where you get to learn a new golf course, major venues especially, where you’re learning how you’ll get around. dd: how have you changed physically? are you swinging faster now than then? tf: i think training with kolby this year has been great. training with kolby and then having butch on the phone has been a really good combination to look at how i’m swinging it. and, for sure, those things have helped me from a consistency basis week to week. dd: i’ll feel as if i haven’t done my duty if i let you go without asking about golf ’s geopolitics. is there a take you’ve been waiting to fire off about liv and the tour but just haven’t found the right time? tf: not really. it’s up to the governing bodies. i’ve never put myself in a position, nor do i want to be in a position, where i am deciding on other people’s whereabouts, on where they can play and can’t play. i like to focus on where i want to play and how i can become the best golfer i can be. dd: with that in mind, what would make you happy at the end of the season? like, man, this year, i accomplished this! tf: win the next three majors. yeah, i think that should do it. dylan dethier is a senior writer for golf magazine/golf.com. the williamstown, mass. native joined golf in 2017 after two years scuffling on the mini-tours. dethier is a graduate of williams college, where he majored in english, and he’s the author of 18 in america, which details the year he spent as an 18-year-old living from his car and playing a round of golf in every state.',\n",

       " 'alan bastable  september 24, 2023  thompson has the word \"faith\" inked on her right arm. getty images not many professional golfers have tattoos, but there are some outliers. max homa has “relentless” inked on the outside of his right wrist. bubba watson has his wife’s name, angie, tatted on his left ring finger. among the handful of permanent markings on rickie fowler: the signature of his late swing coach, barry mcdonnell, on the inside of his left wrist. and then there’s lexi thompson, who you might have been watching on golf channel over the past couple of days. as a member of the u.s. solheim cup team, which is squaring off against their european counterparts in a tight contest in spain, thompson already has helped her side pick up two points with an opportunity for a third point still in the balance: her sunday singles showdown against emily pedersen of denmark. thompson has three visible tattoos: the olympic rings on the inside of her left wrist; an arrow and the word “faith” on her right forearm/wrist; and, on the inside of her right wrist, flower heads with “psalm 46:5” inked just above. as you might expect, each holds important meaning to thompson. the olympic rings speak to thompson’s patriotism, of which she has an abundance. that was evident in the run-up to the 2016 summer games in rio, when thompson’s primary mission for the year was earning the right to represent her country. “ever since i found that golf was back in the olympics, i’ve just been prepping for that,” thompson said after the first round of the women’s olympic event. “that was my no. 1 goal, to be on this team. i’ve just been working really hard on my game trying to tighten everything up and work on the mental side of it, as well, because i know that’s a big factor in golf.” thompson was asked if playing in the olympics was a higher priority than trying to bag another major title.  “to me, yes,” she said. “i think the olympics is higher than any major. we have five majors a year, and we only have one olympics every four years, and golf is back in it since 1904. i don’t think there’s a comparison to having a gold medal.” thompson finished 19th in the event but not landing on the podium did nothing to quell her national pride.   four years later, when she got the call confirming that would she would again be playing for team usa, this time at the tokyo games, she said she got chills. “that was my no. 1 goal going into the year, and i busted my butt on the practice facilities to get that locked up,” she said. (thompson finished well down the board again, in 33rd, but did get to see her compatriot, nelly korda, take gold.)   earlier this year, thompson played in a golf outing that honored the u.s. navy seals, a branch of the military for which she has long shown support. at a pro-am in virginia years ago, she made a memorable entrance, skydiving onto the course from 10,000 feet with an assist from a retired navy seal; the leap was intended to promote her partnership with the seal legacy foundation, which supports families of wounded and fallen seals. this week, in spain, there was no doubting what thompson’s spot on the solheim cup meant to her. in her first press conference of the week, she wasted little time in saying so. “it’s my no. 1 goal to be on that team to be able to represent my country,” she said. “it’s my favorite event by far. there’s nothing like waking up, putting country’s colors on, and going to represent and be alongside a team at that.” thompson is reminded of that feeling every time she looks at the inside of her left wrist, which is where she had the olympic rings inked in the fall of 2017. “something i’ve wanted to get ever since i went to the olympics, can’t be more honored that i was able to represent the usa in brazil” she wrote on instagram. “so much meaning behind this tattoo and it will always remind me of all my hard work. i will wear these rings with pride.” thompson’s two other tats hint at another core part of her makeup: her christian faith. the more visible of the two is on the outside of her right forearm. applied in 2019 in blank ink, the tattoo depicts an arrow with the word “faith” in script. “the arrow is just to keep on going forward,” thompson told golfweek soon after she had commissioned the body art, which she said, on a pain scale of 1 to 10, was a 4. “god will have me on the right path.” lower on the same arm, on the inside of her wrist, thompson has more lettering above a floral pattern: “psalm 46:5,” which, according to the new international version of the bible, reads: “god is within her, she will not fall; god will help her at break of day.” thompson has, on occasion, used social media to express the importance of her faith. after a first-round 64 at an lpga event in thailand in 2016, she wrote on instagram: “have faith, keep believing in god’s promises, he is always faithful. god blesses the faithful and those who honor him. i remind myself everyday that i should be grateful for everything and everyone i’ve been blessed with in my life.” three days layer, thompson won the event by six, marking what at the time was her seventh lpga victory. (she has won four more times since then.) on sunday, thompson will try to add another bullet to her resume, in one of the biggest spots of her career. with the solheim cup knotted at 8-8 after the first four sessions, thompson is playing in the anchor match for the u.s. on saturday evening, she was asked how she’s feeling after having played three matches on the hilly host site, finca cortesin. “ready to go,” she said. added thompson’s saturday foursomes partner megan khang: “i think this week is just purely adrenaline. if you feel like you’re tired, you forget about it because the crowd’s right there picking you up. you have your partner looking at you going like, ‘let’s go.’ lexi is literally like, ‘come on, we can do it.’ i’m like, ‘i can do it. my little legs can keep up.’ “lexi’s a beast.” as golf.com’s executive editor, bastable is responsible for the editorial direction and voice of one of the game’s most respected and highly trafficked news and service sites. he wears many hats — editing, writing, ideating, developing, daydreaming of one day breaking 80 — and feels privileged to work with such an insanely talented and hardworking group of writers, editors and producers. before grabbing the reins at golf.com, he was the features editor at golf magazine. a graduate of the university of richmond and the columbia school of journalism, he lives in new jersey with his wife and foursome of kids.  as golf.com’s executive editor, bastable is responsible for the editorial direction and voice of one of the game’s most respected and highly trafficked news and service sites. he wears many hats — editing, writing, ideating, developing, daydreaming of one day breaking 80 — and feels privileged to work with such an insanely talented and hardworking group of writers, editors and producers. before grabbing the reins at golf.com, he was the features editor at golf magazine. a graduate of the university of richmond and the columbia school of journalism, he lives in new jersey with his wife and foursome of kids. includes 12 srixon z-star xv golf balls, 1 yr of golf magazine, $20 fairway jockey credit - and much more! golf.com and golf magazine are published by eb golf media llc, a division of 8am golf    ',\n",
       " \"james colgan  september 23, 2023  lexi thompson's solheim cup shank wasn't the talk of the golf world on saturday — but her response to it was. getty images casares, spain — early in my golf.com career, i caught a devastating case of the shanks. it was fall 2021 and i was in southern california for a video series based around a swing lesson from legendary swing coach dave phillips. we hired a videographer and flew in our photographer and two fellow writers for the occasion, taking over the hulking titleist performance institute for a few hours. (the other attendees won’t be named for purposes of protecting the innocent.) after a few minutes of polite conversation, we turned the cameras on and started swinging — which was also the moment i realized i was in for the worst hour of my life. i felt like i swung the club the same way i had for the previous six months of my life, but the result was decidedly not anything i was used to seeing. instead of my typical gentle hook, i found the most consistent — and deeply horrifying — result of my golfing life: a 70-yard hosel-rocket.  the cameras rolled on my disaster for about 30 minutes. my face turned a new shade of magenta. my entire body tensed with dread. my coworkers begged me to figure it out. it was no use. phillips, a brilliant swing coach whose clientele includes jon rahm, was speechless. i could feel him wince with every shot.  i remember hitting 50ish consecutive shanks that day before we finally called the whole thing off — though it’s hard to say how my brain’s trauma response affected my memory of the ordeal.  just writing about it makes me want to vomit.  i volunteer this memory to remind us all — myself included — that shanks are human.  of golf’s many shin-kicks, none feel more painful than the hosel-adjacent miss, and yet nobody is capable of avoiding them entirely. tiger dealt with ’em, jack dealt with ’em, you deal with ’em and i most certainly deal with ’em, too. hitting a shank is like stubbing your toe — you just hope when it happens you’re somewhere private enough to shed a tear.  on friday evening at the solheim cup, lexi thompson experienced a painful reminder of this truth. on the 18th green of her second match of the day, a bruising fourball battle with leona maguire and georgia hall, thompson faced a tricky chip shot from a sidehill lie and shanked it. it was likely the most pivotal moment of the tournament to that point — the third shot in a tied match with thompson needing birdie to keep the americans alive. it ended in disaster.  oh no lexi thompson #solheimcup2023 pic.twitter.com/pqedimdbjo in the immediate aftermath of the shank, the u.s. side offered an exemplary look at how one should respond to such a public disappointment. thompson nearly holed her next shot, a brilliant chip from just off the putting surface, then graciously congratulated both of her opponents on a match well won. off to the side of the green, her teammates quickly rallied to her defense, offering concerned looks and later, genuine consolation. megan khang, the 5-foot-nothing soul of this u.s. squad, even found herself working crowd control.  “now that’s just rude,” she said, whipping around to chide a snickering euro fan, who quickly shut his mouth. but the feel-good story only lasted the better part of an hour, until thompson found herself sitting in the u.s. team’s friday evening press conference. after fielding a series of softball questions about the quality of her play throughout the day (which, to her credit, had been largely tremendous) and the difficulty of walking 36 holes, sports illustrated reporter alex miceli was handed the microphone. finally, he posed the question everyone wanted to hear. “lexi, could you talk about that third shot on 18?” miceli asked. “there was some question on what you were trying to do and what you actually did do on the third shot. could you just go through it for us?” thompson didn’t. “i don’t need to comment on that.” “excuse me?” miceli said. “i don’t need to comment on the chip,” she said again, holding her gaze. “it was a bad lie, and i didn’t hit a good chip, but it was pretty much impossible, so…” quickly, a member of the lpga’s communications staff swooped in to redirect the conversation, but not before u.s. team captain stacy lewis delivered a snipe of her own. “that’s a terrible question,” lewis said. the press conference continued as usual after that moment, but the damage had already been done. suddenly, the shank was awkward. confounding answer from lexi and subsequent reaction from the us side. it was one of the pivotal moments of the entire day and somehow that's off limits? pic.twitter.com/9std3lflmn by the time morning broke on saturday in spain, thompson’s response was the talk of the golf internet.  social media accounts tied to various members of golf media quickly rallied to miceli’s defense, criticizing thompson and lewis for their response to what they saw as a fair and understandable question. others watching from home, including thompson’s former solheim cup teammate jess korda, saw the situation differently. “so sad seeing golf media, yet again, shred lexi,” korda tweeted. “it’s easy writing about other people’s mistakes. it’s golf, bad shots happen — give the girl a break. she grows the game more than anyone on tour… and she’s a great player!!” this isn’t the first time this critique has been surfaced from members of the women’s game — that golf media spends too much time preying on the failures of women’s golf — and we’ve heard it before specifically in regard to thompson, whose career has been marked by major championship heartbreak on a handful of different occasions.  that is a complex issue, and one always worth considering. but the truth of this situation is actually far simpler than matters of gender or media bias. the truth is that the persisting awkwardness surrounding the shank exists exclusively because of lexi’s approach to answering the question. yes, it would be every bit fair if she entered that press conference upset about the shot, and it is every bit her right to decline to answer any question she’s asked. it is also every bit her captain’s prerogative to feel protective over her players. it’s also fair to point out that bedside manner is important when asking these questions, and while i might not have found any issue with the miceli’s forthrightness, thompson and lewis might have. in any case, though, korda’s right. it’s golf, and bad shots happen all the time. i’m more than willing to give lexi a break for hitting an ill-timed shank, as i’m sure the overwhelming majority of golf media is. but it’s important to note that the reason the shank became a talking point (rather than just a relatable mistake in a high-pressure situation) didn’t stem from golf media’s ability to give lexi a break. it came from her response! miceli wasn’t acting maliciously; he was doing his job, which at the most basic level is to serve as a proxy for the fan. any fan watching the solheim cup on friday evening wanted to know what happened with lexi’s chip, and it would be no less than professional malpractice for those in the room not to ask.  thompson knows this, and so does lewis. no athlete survives for more than 15 minutes in the public eye without learning the burden of scrutiny that comes with the job. some face more scrutiny than others and some handle that weight better than others, but no one is afforded the freedom to avoid it entirely. without scrutiny (and the fandom, investment and commerce it engenders), there is no professional golf in its current form (nor with its current purses). i’m sure that further down the line, lexi and lewis will both admit miceli’s question caught them in a tense, disappointed moment. that their response wasn’t a reflection of their true feelings about the question, but rather the adrenaline of a high-pressure weekend. but for now we only have that moment — and the resulting response. it’s easy to understand why this issue turned into a landmine. women’s golf is underfunded, under-supported and underexposed relative to their male counterparts, which makes the media attention the sport receives significantly more impactful to its success. good press is good for business, but not all press is good press.  in a social media world where misogynistic comments can run unchecked, it’s hardly difficult to get why some female athletes would take negative coverage personally, or why many of them wish for advocacy from golf media.  the funny thing is, the vast majority of female pros deserve to be advocated for. on the whole they are more generous with their time, happier to accept accountability for their failures and less fearful of vulnerability than their male counterparts. these are the traits that turn ordinary golfers into role models and fan favorites, and those traits are undoubtedly responsible for some of the gains the women’s game has seen over the last decade. in this era of media distrust, it’s easy to forget the many ways in which media coverage can benefit those being covered. that doesn’t mean the media will always be beneficial, but it sure doesn’t mean they’re inherently corrupt and bad. those people are often people like me — i’m writing this no more than 20 feet from the solheim cup podium — and lord knows i know a thing or two about the shanks. soon this episode will be but a footnote to an otherwise thrilling solheim cup script, a development i’m sure will be welcomed by all parties involved. and when sunday’s singles matches were announced, thompson’s name came in the final match of the day, where she’ll face off against emily pedersen. as a result, she’ll be a large part of answering the weekend’s biggest question: who hoists the cup. james colgan is a news and features editor at golf, writing stories for the website and

       " \"dylan dethier  september 23, 2023  carlota ciganda is off to a red-hot 3-0 start at the solheim cup. getty images the solheim cup is tied, 8-8. so we don’t know the winner yet. we don’t know the loser. but let’s not let that stop us. which people, players and philosophies won saturday? here they are: 10 winners (and, just for balance, losers) from day 2 at the solheim cup. after the u.s. swept the first foursomes session 4-0 on friday, things looked a bit dire for the host squad. the sweep was so jarring it transcended basic match play; the u.s. advantage felt philosophical. stacy lewis was leaning on an analytical approach to her pairings and that approach was working. but a 3-1 friday afternoon triumph brought europe closer. a 2-2 saturday morning split maintained the u.s. team lead. and another dominant european afternoon — 3-1, again — brought the match dead even. that included some unpredictable lineup moves, like playing the team’s lowest-ranked golfer emily pedersen in all five matches. european captain suzann pettersen has been coaching by feel, and that earned a mixed response on friday. but it’s been working, too. suzann pettersen’s press conference was something else. my favorite part… pic.twitter.com/mi6gub6yvg “this is a different event,” said pettersen. “it’s about energy, adrenaline, momentum. it was almost hard for me to pick and choose who was actually going to go out this afternoon because we had so many that were just red-hot and ready to go. “so i mean, it was literally almost flip a coin for some of them who i picked at the end. but we tried to base it off stats, tried to match up as good as we could, and it worked out fairly good.” the contrast in styles, personalities, approaches — it’s terrific. when some golfers play a lot, others inevitably play very little. let’s be clear: dryburgh is not herself a “loser” in any sense. she hasn’t even lost a match this week! but after gutting out a half-point on friday afternoon, dryburgh was benched all saturday. she and caroline hedwall — who teed it up for the first time on saturday afternoon — are the only players to tee it up just once in the first four sessions. lexi thompson and lilia vu lost their friday fourball match in heartbreaking fashion when thompson shanked a greenside eagle chip on no. 18 to lose 1 down. it would have been easy to let that carry over into saturday foursomes; it didn’t. thompson and red-hot partner megan khang went 2 down to the european side of anna nordqvist and leona maguire but weathered the storm and made par after par to eke out a 1 up victory. thompson’s 2-1-0 record through team play is a huge success. “that’s the whole thing with match play, you can never give up, and you never know when it can turn, so you have to stay in it and stay in the moment,” thompson said after her match. it was cool seeing her so invigorated; this year hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows. speaking of which… thompson declining to answer questions about said friday afternoon shank was noteworthy, but the video of that exchange didn’t make its way to the collective golf internet until saturday morning when posted by no laying up‘s tron carter. confounding answer from lexi and subsequent reaction from the us side. it was one of the pivotal moments of the entire day and somehow that's off limits? pic.twitter.com/9std3lflmn what’s the big deal? why the big response? thompson is, of course, well within her rights to not talk about the least pleasant moment of her week. and thompson has had understandable gripes with press coverage over the years. but i think the way she and lewis acted as though the question should never have been asked seemed to set people off. our james colgan wrote more about the entire thing here, so dive in. but i think the takeaway is actually pretty simple here. if you’re advising lexi thompson, just tell her to acknowledge the moment! let us in! it was a tough chip! we all suck at chipping! we’re all even worse at chipping under pressure! that’s golf. the question was inevitable. better to take ownership of the moment and get people on your side rather than keeping them out. not only did yin appear to be having the most fun of any solheim cup contestant, but she also appeared to be pummeling the longest drives. yin hadn’t earned a point heading to saturday’s afternoon session — and she and partner cheyenne knight were 2 down through 10 holes. but then the pair reeled off several birdies to keep europe from sweeping the session. that was punctuated by yin hammering some sort of mid-iron into 18, a par-5 where most players have been laying up, setting up a two-putt birdie and a match victory. icing the match 🧊angel yin reached the green in two on 18 to help @solheimcupusa win a much needed point in spain 👏 pic.twitter.com/8kexsms0qf it was surprising to see world no. 2 lilia vu sit the first session. but it was far more surprising to see her lose in each of the next three sessions. none of the three were blowouts — she reached the 18th hole on friday and the 17th hole in both matches on saturday — but vu is the only american without at least a half-point. it’s not often you see a right-handed golfer nail a left-handed fist pump. tiger woods is the godfather of the modern golf fist pump, after all, and his is consistent: hold the putter in the left hand, pump with the right. but grant has had plenty of opportunities to celebrate through four matches — she’s 3-1, having played all four sessions — and the lefty thing is growing on me. no right-handed golfer has ever really mastered the lefty fist pump but i feel like linn grant is getting there pic.twitter.com/hdnkxiyaz3 the real point here: linn grant is very, very good at golf. there are very few women better than linn grant at golf. i’m not sure there’s anyone in this cup i’d want to face less in a match. hey, tv people: help out my little hamster brain, please! i need help remembering the match scores. i need help remembering who is playing who. we need some context! i kept a leaderboard tab open on my laptop while watching just to keep track of the matches; that feels like the broadcast’s job. (and yes, i considered the possibility that i’m just an idiot but plenty of others on the internet seemed to share this particular gripe.) there’s only one golfer at this week’s spanish solheim cup who hails from spain. there’s also only one golfer who has a 3-0 record. the fact that those are the same golfer is nothing short of remarkable. kudos to carlota ciganda, who was already an emotional center for the european side before she started toppling opponents like dominos. scenes on the 16th as carlota sends @solheimcupeuro  2up in the final match 🇪🇺#teameurope | #solheimcup pic.twitter.com/l8ihkkkhiz this is a personal pet peeve: when pros are “freed up” to hit must-make putts with no consequences for missing, some take the opportunity to absolutely rifle the ball past the cup. but that’s not how putts go in! we’ve dived into these numbers before. when the ball approaches the hole at dying speed, the hole is effectively much bigger. i get why pros try to take out some break by hitting the ball harder, and there’s something to be said for it, but if a putt goes like 10 feet past the hole it probably wasn’t going in on any line. okay, i said i was just going to do 10 and now we’re at 11. but i can’t go without shouting out leona maguire — who’s an absolute menace — plus her semi-injured partner charley hull. the two teamed up to take down nelly korda and ally ewing 4 and 3 on saturday afternoon. shoutout also to madelene sagstrom, who picked up her first team victory in her sixth team match across three cups. shoutout to emily pedersen, who went from a fringe captain’s pick to must-watch tv — not just because of her ace but because of everything that came after. and shoutout to us, the viewers. an 8-8 tie is a hell of a way to go to sunday singles. see you there! match 1, 5:10 a.m. – megan khang (usa) vs. linn grant (eur) match 2, 5:22 a.m. – rose zhang (usa) vs. leona maguire (eur) match 3, 5:34 a.m. – danielle kang (usa) vs. charley hull (eur) match 4, 5:46 a.m. – jennifer kupcho (usa) vs. anna nordqvist (eur) match 5, 5:58 a.m. – andrea lee (usa) vs. georgia hall (eur) match 6, 6:10 a.m. – cheyenne knight (usa) vs. gemma dryburgh (eur) match 7, 6:22 a.m. – angel yin (usa) vs. celine boutier (eur) match 8, 6:34 a.m. – ally ewing (usa) vs. caroline hedwall (eur) match 9, 6:46 a.m. – lilia vu (usa) vs. madelene sagstrom (eur) match 10, 6:58 a.m. – allisen corpuz (usa) vs. maja stark (eur) match 11, 7:10 a.m. – nelly korda (usa) vs. carlota ciganda (eur) match 12, 7:12 a.m. – lexi thompson (usa) vs. emily pedersen (eur) dylan dethier is a senior writer for golf magazine/golf.com. the williamstown, mass. native joined golf in 2017 after two years scuffling on the mini-tours. dethier is a graduate of williams college, where he majored in english, and he’s the author of 18 in america, which details the year he spent as an 18-year-old living from his car and playing a round of golf in every state.  dylan dethier is a senior writer for golf magazine/golf.com. the williamstown, mass. native joined golf in 2017 after two years scuffling on the mini-tours. dethier is a graduate of williams college, where he majored in english, and he’s the author of 18 in america, which details the year he spent as an 18-year-old living from his car and playing a round of golf in every state. includes 12 srixon z-star xv golf balls, 1 yr of golf magazine, $20 fairway jockey credit - and much more! golf.com and golf magazine are published by eb golf media llc, a division of 8am golf    \",\n",
       " 'author: kristen shilton date: sep 25, 2023, 07:00 am et publication: espn.com  the dawn of an nhl season offers unparalleled promise. it\\'s a slate wiped clean for the ultimate fresh start. everyone\\'s on equal footing again, in an official erasure of whatever happened -- good or bad -- the prior campaign. that opening puck drop doesn\\'t come without months of preparation, though, and we\\'re not just talking in the gym. getting game-day ready goes beyond just the weight a player can handle on the squat rack -- to how they manage the load of inevitable expectation on their shoulders. \"i think the hardest part of pro hockey and being in the nhl isn\\'t necessarily the physical part,\" anaheim ducks forward troy terry told espn at the nhl\\'s player tour in las vegas this month. \"it\\'s the mental side of things.\" and how. terry is one of several top skaters within their organizations who\\'ve recently learned that lesson -- among others -- the hard way. focusing on the body -- how it\\'s fueled, trained and rested -- is (relatively) easy to control. but there\\'s no guarantee it translates into on-ice results. when there\\'s a disconnect between the two, doubt naturally creeps in. pressure ramps up. terry felt that in anaheim last season during what was just his second full nhl campaign. tom wilson, coming off his 10th season with the washington capitals, went through a frustrating ride of his own in 2022-23. veterans and newbies alike can\\'t escape a down, disappointing, or demoralizing year. but they can all use it as an opportunity to snap back -- and level up. that\\'s why, after a too-long summer for too many nhlers, the 2023-24 season can\\'t begin soon enough. when it does, some skaters will be eyeing their own sort of resurgence -- whether coming off injury, a disappointing individual performance or by simply trying to prove (to themselves, and everyone else) why this season will be better than ever. terry couldn\\'t understand what happened in mid-december last season. after scoring 12 goals and 28 points in his first 31 games, he hit a wall. hard. \"i went 16 games at that point last year without scoring a goal, which was tough for me,\" terry said. \"when i look back at it, i think i played well, i was getting points, but for whatever reason during that time i just could not score. and it put my goal totals off for the rest of this year.\" that roadblock was uncharted territory for terry on the heels of his much-lauded breakout effort. the 26-year-old made waves in 2021-22 -- his first full nhl season -- producing 37 goals and 67 points in 75 games, becoming the youngest ducks player in franchise history to record a point streak of 15 games or longer, and being voted to his first nhl all-star game appearance. those stats not only put terry on the nhl\\'s radar in a major way, they earned him a seven-year, $49 million contract extension in the offseason that committed some of the best days of his playing career to anaheim. get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers. • four nba teams likely to improve » • barnwell explains big nfl surprises » • bold predictions for all 32 nhl teams »  more espn+ content » terry anticipated not just meeting any newfound expectations associated with the long-term deal, but surpassing them. but on an anaheim squad deep into rebuilding, it was terry who found his own foundation shaken despite notching a solid 23 goals and 61 points through 70 games. \"it\\'s funny, i had similar point totals [in 2022-23 as before], but my goal [numbers] being off was hard,\" he said. \"but as a player, i think i took steps, and it\\'s nice when we have a young team, and i was lucky enough to sign a long deal. so, i think my focus is just being a good hockey player and being a good teammate this year. that usually helps translate into points.\" taking a cue from his home base in the eternal summer of southern california, terry is determined to maintain a sunny mindset. his newest housemate has been an invaluable source of inspiration in that respect; terry and his wife, dani, welcomed greyson james in april, a life-changing experience that put everything -- including hockey -- into much-needed perspective. \"having a kid and everything that\\'s changed [because of that] in my life, you start to not live or die by how you\\'re doing on the ice,\" terry said. \"you realize there\\'s more important things in your world. not that hockey is not important, but you\\'re more than just a hockey player. and i think that\\'s been my mentality switch, and when you\\'re going through times like that [without scoring], it helps.\" terry said he\\'s \"really excited\" now for the season ahead even as the ducks\\' continued retool is bound to bring about its own challenges. like it or not, growing pains come with the domain for terry, on the ice and at home. it\\'s the latter life, though, that truly brings terry the most joy these days, even if -- like his day job -- there are highs and lows through which to wade. \"fatherhood is harder than i ever thought it would be,\" terry admitted. \"but i also love that guy more than i thought i could love something. so, it\\'s been pretty fun.\" veteran tampa bay lightning defenseman mikhail sergachev might appear soft-spoken. but what he does say hits hard. \"i want to get to the top,\" sergachev said. \"i want to be the best: on our team first, and then in the league.\" that\\'s exactly the mic drop mentality tampa bay needs from its burgeoning star. the 25-year-old blueliner was acquired by the lightning in 2017 to eventually be where he is now -- cresting their defensive depth chart as one of the team\\'s highest-paid players thanks to an eight-year, $68 million contract kicking in this season. sergachev doesn\\'t take the team\\'s commitment to him lightly. he produced the best season of his career across the board in 2022-23, tallying 10 goals and 64 points in 79 games, averaging a team-high 23 minutes, 49 seconds of ice time per game, and earning a significant role on the lightning power play. it was disappointing, then, for sergachev -- and the lightning at large -- to see how they came up short in a first-round playoff loss to toronto. tampa bay\\'s run of back-to-back stanley cup victories, followed by another cup final appearance, set a high standard that sergachev is determined not to let slip. especially given the profound impact the team\\'s investment in his future has already had. \"i appreciate it a lot,\" sergachev said. \"when they gave me an eight-year deal, like i don\\'t want to say i didn\\'t expect it, but i just felt that they trusted me and they believed in me, and it changed my perspective on a lot of things. it made me believe in myself more.\" what that translates to over the next few years is on sergachev to create. it\\'s likely no coincidence the new pact coincided with sergachev\\'s excellent season. the goal now is to recreate that success individually, and hope it also rubs off on the rest of his team. \"i understand things better now,\" sergachev said. \"i signed a long-term deal. the team trusted me on the first power play [last season]. so, it\\'s a lot of responsibility going into this season. every year, every summer, every training camp that i take, i have to focus on that [responsibility] and give it everything i have.\" one of the top rising stars in the league, jason robertson has a singular focus with the dallas stars this season. and it\\'s echoing like a mantra: consistency. \"i don\\'t want to just be catching fire and then not really doing a whole lot later in the season,\" robertson said. \"it\\'s just staying that same player i can be and having that high expectation to try to play the best i can offensively, but do it consistently and try to maintain the other aspects of the game as well at the same time.\" if roberson\\'s goal-setting ability is anything like his goal-scoring one, then the stars are in for a treat. because their top-line winger is ready to fly even higher. the 24-year-old was a behemoth on the ice in 2022-23, producing 46 goals and 109 points in 82 games to rank him seventh and sixth, respectively, overall in the nhl. for context, the only skaters who notched more points than robertson were connor mcdavid, leon draisaitl, david pastrnak, nikita kucherov and nathan mackinnon. but the postseason was a different story, as he scored just two goals and 10 assists in the opening two rounds (including no goals in seven games against the kraken), before coming alive against vegas in the conference finals. robertson talks about his game as a work in progress, and he\\'s dialed in on maintaining good habits. \"if i\\'m consistent in what i do and what i play, the numbers will take care of themselves,\" he said. \"that\\'s just what happens. you work hard, you don\\'t get complacent, then you know you\\'re going to get opportunities. you\\'re going to get chances. you play on too good of a team not to; too good of a roster not to get those opportunities. so, it\\'s up to me to just try to stick to that [mindset], keep working hard and don\\'t get complacent.\" the same could be said for the stars overall. dallas put together an 108-point season under first year head coach pete deboer and advanced to the western conference finals. the stars came up short there in a six-game loss to the eventual cup champion golden knights, but the result has done nothing to curb robertson\\'s enthusiasm for what dallas can accomplish in the coming season.  get your favorite live sports, stories and originals with espn+, disney+ and hulu. upgrade to a disney bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today! \"it\\'s winning it all,\" he said. \"that\\'s what you want to do. we have those expectations. we have the players, the coach that it takes the win. everyone has a recipe to win. we\\'ve got a big forward group, great defensemen, an elite goalie. you have all those criteria that were checked off. \"so, we have high expectations this year, and we\\'re fortunate enough to where our gm [jim nill] has built this group well. and the young guys are going to step up and take control, like me and the younger guys. so, we\\'re excited.\" here\\'s where robertson will digress, though. yes, as a fourth-year pro, there is a natural progression toward shouldering more locker room duties and being a good example. just don\\'t anticipate robertson breaking away from who he\\'s been all along. on and off the ice, robertson\\'s moves have served him and the stars well. the right formula now is just generating more of what works -- even more often. \"all i\\'ve got to do is keep working hard, keeping playing the right way and just lead by example,\" he said. \"i like to say i\\'m a leader. i have a big responsibility in myself to not put myself ahead of the team in any situation, so i think i\\'ve been doing a good job in that. i\\'m ready to get back at it.\" there\\'s wisdom in growing older as a person and a hockey player. capitals winger tom wilson can attest that\\'s the truth. \"you kind of learn to live in the moment,\" wilson said of getting deeper into his career. \"you take it game by game. right now, we have a really good group of guys in our room. age obviously doesn\\'t really matter if everyone\\'s playing well and doing their thing and winning games. people like to look to the future and plan, but our job as players is to win each game, win every night, and if you do that, the rest will take care of itself.\" ideally, wilson would like to contribute more to the winning part this season than he was able to recently. the 29-year-old missed the first half of 2022-23 recovering from offseason acl surgery. he made it back into the lineup by january and lasted a mere eight games before a blocked shot against colorado caused a \"small, small fracture\" in an ankle that was big enough to sideline wilson through mid-february. still, the winger was a productive player for washington, producing 13 goals and 22 points in 33 games. and gm brian maclellan recognized wilson\\'s value with a massive seven-year, $45.5 million contract extension that starts next season to carry wilson through (presumably) the majority of his remaining nhl seasons. but those extended absences last season were some of many that ultimately doomed the injury-plagued capitals to a down season. washington recorded the fourth-most man games lost amid ailments to wilson, nicklas backstrom, t.j. oshie and john carlson; it was no surprise by the march trade deadline to see maclellan trading players away, torpedoing any lingering hope washington had of making the playoffs. wilson says now he\\'s \"feeling good; a lot better\" than the previous offseason and used an extended summer to get his body back in the game, so to speak. next is trying to bring washington back from the brink. the capitals have a new head coach in spencer carbery, a milestone machine on a mission in alex ovechkin and, with a healthy carlson, backstrom and wilson, some legitimate optimism for the year ahead. that\\'s what wilson will cling too, anyway. even if the 2022-23 season ended with a thud, there\\'s reason to believe the coming campaign can open with a bang. \"i think [my goals] all revolve around team success,\" wilson said. \"we want to get back to where we want to be. we want to have that winning culture and mentality that we\\'ve built for the last 10-15 years in washington. and if i\\'m doing my job, if i\\'m playing well, i think it\\'ll help the team win games, and that\\'s the most important thing.\" and if wilson has to take over a bigger role -- whether on the ice or in the dressing room -- he\\'s prepared to learn on the fly there, too. \"i\\'m pretty fortunate to have had so many leaders to look to, and now i\\'m in the middle of my career and in the second wave [to start standing up],\" he said. \"but those guys [like ovechkin and backstrom] are the best and i love having them around and just try and soak it all in when you can.\" forget the cliched \"roller-coaster ride\" analogy. for the past two years, nashville predators forward filip forsberg has been on a carnivalesque tilt-a-whirl, complete with thrilling highs and stomach-dropping lows. let\\'s recap: it was only in 2021-22 when forsberg emerged with a breakout season, collecting 42 goals and 84 points in 69 games for a predators team that defied expectations earning a postseason berth. forsberg parlayed his success into a mammoth new deal with nashville, avoiding free agency in the summer of 2022 by agreeing to an eight-year, $68 million extension. the predators -- and forsberg along with them -- seemed well positioned to rise even further in 2022-23. until the wheels fell off. instead of thriving out of the gate, nashville immediately fell into a fight just to keep pace in the playoff race. the predators were four points out of a wild-card spot in february when forsberg -- then the team\\'s second-leading scorer with 19 goals and 42 points in 50 games -- suffered a concussion against philadelphia. forsberg never returned for the predators. the team\\'s alarming number of injuries -- to him, roman josi, ryan johansen, and others -- led to nashville spiraling out of postseason contention from there. the fallout came fast and furious. head coach jon hynes was fired (and eventually replaced by andrew brunette). gm david poile finalized his retirement, with barry trotz taking over. and trotz wasted no time giving nashville a face-lift, buying out matt duchene\\'s contract, trading johansen to colorado and adding veterans such as ryan o\\'reilly, gustav nyquist and luke schenn in free agency. it\\'s been 24 months of whiplash, basically. what forsberg needs now is some rejuvenation -- with a side of stability. \"you kind of have to see it that way,\" he said about rebounding this season. \"you miss 32 games [in 2022-23], you feel like you had a tough year. it might not have been as bad as it felt, but at the same time, you don\\'t play for half the season, it\\'s obvious you\\'re going to have to bounce back and try to find something to build off. i\\'m excited just to get a chance to be out there competing with my teammates again.\" the predators\\' locker room looks different than before, too. forsberg is one of a few remaining veterans from nashville\\'s lineup in 2021-22, a clear indication of how the organization has pivoted toward its up-and-comers (including philip tomasino, cody glass and thomas novak). if forsberg is wearied by all that change, he doesn\\'t show it. if anything, he\\'s attempting to flourish from it, and holds faith that he and the predators can make the most of what awaits this season. \"i feel great. i\\'m excited about [what\\'s next],\" he said. \"i think our [retooling] has been done correctly, so to speak. obviously, you don\\'t want to see any of your friends and teammates leave, but at least we\\'ve done a good job trying to replace them with other players, and i\\'m excited to get to know coach brunette as well.\" ',\n",
       " 'author: coley harvey date: sep 25, 2023, 07:00 am et publication: espn.com  new york -- aaron judge was quiet. when asked what he learned about his team during a difficult first year as captain, the five-time all-star took a full 16 seconds before responding. from his locker at the far end of the new york yankees clubhouse, judge stood, his eyes scanning the room as his mind scanned everything that happened this year. \"honestly,\" the 31-year-old outfielder said, \"this really tested everybody\\'s character. it tested my character.\" for the first time since judge made his mlb debut in 2016, the yankees\\' bad days outweighed the good. on sunday, whatever still-existing playoff dreams the team might have had were officially dashed when a loss to the arizona diamondbacks eliminated new york from postseason contention. and throughout the yankees\\' final homestand, which ends monday, judge and his teammates admitted this has been a year they hope to never repeat. \"you kind of get tested at a time when things aren\\'t going your way, when guys get hurt, you\\'re not getting the call that you want, the ball\\'s not falling the way that you want it to,\" judge told espn. \"it challenges you to continue to show up every day and compete. this just really tested guys. you\\'ve really got to want to be here. you\\'ve really got to want it and bring it every single day.\" the yankees\\' 2023 season ends sunday in kansas city. instead of a postseason, as october begins, the yankees will be taking vacations, going on fishing trips, spending time with loved ones, reconditioning their bodies and resetting their minds. they certainly won\\'t be playing for a world series. \"when you come to new york, you\\'ve got to win. it\\'s about winning a world series,\" judge said. \"if you don\\'t win a world series, it\\'s like: \\'what are we doing?\\'\" after getting as far as the american league championship series in three of the past six seasons, the yankees will be at home in october for the first time since 2016. although there is a belief throughout the club that this season will ultimately be a minor blip, that doesn\\'t change the reality of what could\\'ve been. \"you take it very personally,\" said manager aaron boone, whose job security after his fifth season in charge remains a question entering the offseason. \"we have to own it, and i have to own it. we are the leaders of this team, and you\\'ve got to take the good with the bad. \"we pour a lot into this, 365 days a year, to be a championship-caliber team, and when we fall short of that ... that\\'s tough.\" nobody knows that better than second baseman gleyber torres, who was called up in 2018. for the first time in his career, he won\\'t be playing any meaningful games in october. \"how we play right now is just like, we don\\'t want that,\" torres said. \"we want to play like how we were last year -- just consistency every day.\" at this point, it isn\\'t surprising that this is the way new york\\'s season is ending. injuries and offensive inconsistency have plagued the organization since early june, making this the year\\'s long-anticipated destination. ahead of opening day, though, there were vastly different expectations. on paper, the yankees were an elite squad thought to be a serious al contender. coming out of spring training, espn\\'s panel of experts ranked them as mlb\\'s fourth-best team, with an 88% chance of making the playoffs and the highest world series odds of any team. for judge, all that makes it even more frustrating that this happened on his watch -- and while he was on the sideline for much of the season, missing 51 games with a toe injury. \"not being out there for the guys every single day, and not helping them give us an opportunity to get to the postseason, that kills me,\" judge said. \"me getting hurt, i felt like i impacted the team and impacted their chances. \"that eats at me every night.\" whether your favorite team is an october favorite or playing out the string, every club has had something go right ... and wrong.  stock watch » the yankees could be inclined to trace the start of their season\\'s demise back to june 3, when judge crashed into the right-field wall at dodger stadium while chasing a deep fly ball. as his 6-foot-7, 280-pound frame ripped through the gated, chain-link portion of the fence, his right foot struck a concrete siding that runs along the very bottom of the outfield wall. the full-speed impact resulted in a torn ligament in his right big toe, sending judge to the injured list. during that stretch, the yankees also lost a number of other players to injuries and inconsistent performance. the 2022 all-star battery of catcher jose trevino and pitcher nestor cortes went down with season-ending injuries. first baseman anthony rizzo suffered post-concussion symptoms from an incident in may and missed significant time, as did starting pitchers luis severino and carlos rodon, designated hitter giancarlo stanton and other once-key yankees -- including josh donaldson and harrison bader -- who aren\\'t even on the team anymore. though judge\\'s lengthy absence from injury won\\'t be remembered as the only factor that led to new york\\'s downfall this season, to him, none of that matters. \"it just goes back to: you only get so many years to get a chance to play here in new york,\" judge said. \"i just signed a long-term deal, so i\\'m going to be here for a couple more years, but there are guys we don\\'t re-sign or they\\'re going to be a free agent, and this could be the one chance to make a postseason or make an impact in new york. and i kind of take responsibility for that. \"not giving them a chance to see what it\\'s like in a postseason in october in new york hurts. them missing out on an opportunity like that, i take full responsibility for that. that\\'s on me. i\\'m the one going out there every single day. i\\'ve got to go out and show up and put our team in the best position.\" boone was not surprised that his star player was laying so much of the fault of the season\\'s failures at his own feet. \"he\\'ll have games periodically during the season where he\\'ll have this great game and then not get a big hit in a big spot and he\\'ll be: \\'it\\'s on me. it\\'s on me,\\'\" boone said. \"he just expects a lot.\" despite seeing a dip in his batting average (from .291 to .268) since returning from the toe injury july 28, judge has nonetheless been a welcome presence in the yankees\\' lineup down the stretch. with two series to go, he has 35 home runs, good for fourth in the al. last week he became the first yankee with multiple three-home run games in a single season. both came after his il return, helping assuage concerns about his recovery and reigniting hope for next season. judge will be back, obviously, as will ace gerrit cole, who capped what is expected to be a cy young award-winning season by tossing an eight-inning two-hitter thursday night -- a performance in which he took a perfect game into the sixth. \"it\\'s disappointing that we\\'ve had the season that we\\'ve had, that\\'s for sure,\" cole said. \"but regardless of if you\\'re in it or you\\'re not, as a professional, you\\'ve got to do your job. sometimes you have to find different ways to get energy, or to focus in games that are maybe obviously a little less intense than they are if you\\'re competing for the division ... [but] people are buying tickets, you\\'re getting paid a salary and honestly, it is still fun.\" now that the trade deadline has passed, kiley mcdaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason.  ohtani and rest of top 10 » judge takes solace in the team\\'s rebound after the last time it missed the playoffs. the 2016 squad went 84-78, and, with a run for the division crown seemingly out of reach by that august, the club called up judge and other young prospects. they finished fourth in the division -- and then made six straight postseason appearances. the message that judge -- the only current yankee to have played in games for that 2016 team -- received from veterans like brett gardner, cc sabathia, brian mccann, mark teixeira and carlos beltran at the time was to keep doing the work. keep improving. \"that was probably the most powerful lesson: just because you made it up here doesn\\'t mean that the journey is over, that the work\\'s over, that the grind\\'s over,\" judge said. \"getting up here and seeing guys like mark teixeira, in spring training seeing alex rodriguez and beltran. they\\'re future hall of famers, and they\\'re still working on their craft. even at age 38, 39, 40. \"you\\'ve got to make adjustments. you can\\'t be satisfied. it\\'s just an eye-opening thing for a lot of guys that hey, the journey\\'s not done. don\\'t be satisfied just because you get the call-up.\" it\\'s the same message that he, cole and the few other veterans in this current clubhouse have passed on to the sizable group of young yankees, like rookie shortstop anthony volpe and outfielder jasson dominguez, who made their debuts or got significant late-season call-up time this year. \"throughout the whole year it\\'s been a wake-up call. and as much as we\\'ve stuck to our routines, there are things that we need to do differently to be better next year,\" 28-year-old pitcher michael king said. \"it\\'s not a fun position to be in. we don\\'t like being here, and i\\'m hoping that all of us don\\'t like being here, and we\\'ll make that transition.\" that attitude is what gives judge confidence in the team\\'s improvement next year. he credits the team\\'s alcs appearance in 2017 in part because of how badly the squad wanted to erase the disappointing ending the year before. the 2024 group will need to follow suit. \"i didn\\'t like the taste of having everybody in the clubhouse, and when the last game was over, that was it,\" judge said. \"just having that taste and seeing the disappointment and seeing the veterans talk about it. i said, \\'i don\\'t want to experience this. i want to be playing the last game of the year all the way to the end.\\' \"so that\\'s one lesson we can take out of this. we\\'ve got a lot of improvements, and a lot of things we\\'ve got to work on and fix for the upcoming years. and the time for that starts now.\" ',\n",
       " 'author: sarah barshop date: sep 25, 2023, 06:00 am et publication: espn.com  thousand oaks, calif. -- as los angeles rams general manager les snead, coach sean mcvay and vice president tony pastoors realized the changes that were coming to their defense following a disappointing 2022 season, they wanted to check in with their future hall of famer. aaron donald sat with them in pastoors\\' office before the start of free agency, where they discussed what the defense might look like in 2023 around the three-time nfl defensive player of the year. the rams knew they\\'d likely be \"losing guys that have been big-time contributors.\" \"he\\'s a great competitor,\" mcvay said of donald. \"he loves a challenge, but i think you don\\'t want to catch people off guard. and the best thing that you can do, and what i\\'ve learned and it certainly hasn\\'t been perfect, is let\\'s try to do that. try to be able to give people an honest understanding of where we\\'re headed.\" donald\\'s reaction resonated with snead. \"he looked you in the eye and said, \\'here\\'s the deal ... i\\'m good, just make sure they care,\\'\" snead said. donald, widely considered one of the best defensive players ever, has been named first-team all-pro seven times. the defensive tackle, who finally added super bowl champion to his resume during the 2021 season, was up for the challenge. \"i just said, \\'bring in guys that\\'s hungry, that\\'s just willing to work, and that\\'s willing to just find ways to tune up and not be satisfied with just being here,\\'\" donald said. \"obviously, you getting a bunch of new guys, and as long as they come in working with the mindset to want to get better we can win with that.\" unlike last year, the expectations for the team\\'s 2023 success were low. cornerback jalen ramsey was traded to the miami dolphins, linebacker bobby wagner returned to the seattle seahawks as a free agent, defensive tackle a\\'shawn robinson signed with the new york giants, linebacker leonard floyd joined the buffalo bills and nose tackle greg gaines headed to the tampa bay buccaneers. donald was not fazed \"because it\\'s like ain\\'t no pressure at all.\" now in his 10th season, donald has played 140 games, all with the rams. he has 103.5 sacks, which includes at least a half-sack on 50 different quarterbacks, according to espn stats & information. \"obviously, the past couple years you been praised so high, now everybody is against you kind of thing,\" donald said. \"you hear it, but me personally, kind of trying to feed off it a little bit because we all need something to try to push us a little bit. so it is different, but i\\'m for the challenge.\" although donald, 32, is in the second half of his career and wants to win now, he has welcomed the opportunity to lead a young team. as the rams prepare for the cincinnati bengals on \"monday night football\" (8:15 et, espn/espn2), it\\'s clear that a roster many thought would be a rebuild is capable of winning games. on defense, a large part of that is because of the presence of donald, not only during games but in the way he has led his young teammates. \"not just in this draft, but in many drafts, we\\'ve often somewhat joked, \\'ok, does this meet the ad standard?\\'\" snead said. often when snead is evaluating a player in the draft, he\\'ll see someone who \"passes the beauty contest\" with the skill level \"but maybe from a love of the game standpoint doesn\\'t really cut it.\" \"and it\\'s like, \\'oh man, i don\\'t know if he passes the ad test,\\'\" snead said. \"so we\\'ve definitely done that over the years as a barometer, as a standard.\" justin lovett has a list on his office whiteboard with 15 names on it. it\\'s \"ad\\'s body count,\" a list of players who have tried -- and failed -- to complete a workout with donald since lovett was hired in 2020 as the rams\\' director of strength and conditioning. this year, rookie defensive linemen kobie turner and desjuan johnson joined lovett\\'s list early during training camp. turner\\'s entry came the first week of camp. though he wasn\\'t keeping up with donald, he was \"doing some of the stuff he did, just at a slower pace.\" but on the second day of their workout, turner \"caught a cramp halfway through and they had to send me down.\" \"it is hard to keep up, but that just goes to show how bad do you really want it?\" johnson said. \"i\\'d be midworkout and i\\'m like, \\'damn, we ain\\'t done yet,\\' he still wants to do some more. i\\'d just be like, \\'i can\\'t complain. that\\'s what it takes to be the best.\\' so i tried my best not to complain. i just embraced the moment and towards the end of the camp as we working out, i asked him, \\'s---, you ready? what else you want to do?\\'\" when asked for his workout routine, donald smiled and said, \"i just do a lot of work.\" \"obviously, the days i\\'m able to get a lot of extra work in, i\\'m in there with [lovett] working certain things,\" donald said. \"i like to look good. so certain things i feel like is getting a little mushy, make sure i keep it feeling the right way.\" donald has yet to identify a rookie who can keep up. \"they ain\\'t been too steady with it,\" he said. before a newcomer tries to work out with donald, lovett said, he\\'ll try to get him to work his way up to the volume the all-pro is doing. \"we talk \\'em through it,\" lovett said. \"say, \\'he\\'s going to do three sets, he\\'s going to do four sets, maybe you start off with two.\\' but they don\\'t want to hear that. they want to be ad. there needs to be a ramp for those guys. so, he\\'s got people that can hang with him for a little bit, but usually it\\'s not as consistent as he would like.\" even though donald wants a challenge, rams defensive line coach eric henderson said he sees the defensive tackle continue to outwork everyone because \"that\\'s who he is. he doesn\\'t take second.\" \"he wants somebody to be competitive with,\" lovett said. \"he doesn\\'t just want to be cooperative and bring you along, he\\'ll bring you in to beat you and to watch you suffer because that actually gives him a little bit more stamina and juice.\" when turner makes a mistake on the field, he knows he\\'s going to hear about it. the rookie said donald isn\\'t hard on his teammates in the meeting room, but if you \"get punked a little on the play, he\\'ll make little sound effects.\" henderson is in on the bit, and he\\'ll replay the clip to let donald continue to make the sound effect -- noises designed to make sure those in the room knows he sees the player on the field getting \"owned,\" turner said. \"i wouldn\\'t say he teases you, but he definitely let it be known that he seen what happened,\" johnson said. \"so if a play didn\\'t go your way, he\\'d be like, \\'mmmm,\\' like damn. one of them, i\\'d be like, \\'wow, he seen that.\\' it helps you in a way because when you out there on the field you like, \\'i don\\'t want ad to see something bad that he start talking junk.\\' \"so it helps you in a way of trying to be on yourself, so when a play do come up and your play is on the field, you made the play and instead of making sound effects he\\'ll say \\'good game, good s---.\\' henderson says this helps \"keep it loose in that room and allow those guys to be themselves.\" sound effects aside, there\\'s also a lot of learning going on. rams defensive coordinator raheem morris called donald a \"quiet leader.\" • rams\\' donald isn\\'t slowing down • can bengals protect joe burrow? • bucs getting it done without brady • can eagles keep brown-smith wr duo? • what\\'s wrong with jaguars? • elliott looking forward to facing cowboys \"people don\\'t give him credit for is his above-the-neck approach to the game,\" henderson said. \"he has an elite feel for what\\'s going on out there on the field, and that\\'s why he\\'s able to anticipate what\\'s happening and play the way he\\'s played. ... he\\'s big-time for these guys that haven\\'t played a lot of ball. they\\'re able to pick his brain.\" whether it\\'s talking to linebacker byron young about how to sell his rush or going against rookie left guard steve avila in practice and showing him pass-rushing moves he has never seen done that way before, donald is always teaching. \"there\\'s a couple times where he\\'s grabbed my back shoulder,\" avila said. \"i\\'m like, \\'dude, i\\'ve never had that happen to me.\\' but then again, in a way of making yourself better is like, \\'ok, how do i not let that happen?\\'\" and while donald has a wealth of knowledge, mcvay said he chooses his spots to be vocal. \"there\\'s nothing more powerful than showing instead of saying, and so he shows what it looks like,\" mcvay said. \"he shows what it looks like to do right in the meeting room, on the practice field, the way that he competes relentlessly in every single opportunity he gets. the great ones elevate people around them, and i think we would all be in agreement and in alignment that certainly aaron is checking all those boxes.\" through two games, the rams\\' defense -- which has two starters remaining from the super bowl lineup -- ranks 28th out of 32 teams in total dvoa. at the start of the season, the rams had the second-youngest team (25.49 years) -- behind the green bay packers (25.3) -- with 15 rookies on the 53-man roster. while this squad has a far different look from veteran-heavy past rams teams, los angeles hopes its young and hungry roster built around donald, 32, will compete with the best in the nfl in the near future. \"we got to just keep working,\" donald said. \"obviously, none of us is there yet, but we looking good. i feel like we looking good, we got them flashes where we look like the type of defense we want to be. it\\'s just about being more consistent and trying to play mistake-free football.\" the confidence comes from having a future hall of famer leading the way. \"[donald] sets a really high standard for the guys in his room and really that whole defense,\" quarterback matthew stafford said. \"and they all know they got to go out there and play at a really high level because they got one of the best of all time, if not the best of all time, going out there with them. \"he raises everybody around him.\" ',\n",

which means it\\'s also occasion to gather all your favourite fantasy hockey-loving mates, or form/join a new league, and get back to the fabulous business of managing a team to eventual glory. or, at least give it the best possible go. allow us to try to help you in that endeavour, beginning with the most important few hours of your entire fantasy season. there\\'s no better occasion to adopt scouting america\\'s timeless motto than ahead of the most important two to three hours of your entire fantasy hockey season. you best be prepared, or 2023-24 could turn into a long and arduous fantasy affair. some advice then, largely, but not only, in step with espn\\'s standard points re-draft league, to help you build the strongest team possible when it matters most.  create or join a fantasy hockey league on espn. your championship run starts today! sign up today! draft the best player available. if connor mcdavid is unspoken for, pick him. if not, grab his teammate leon draisaitl. then david pastrnak, auston matthews, nathan mackinnon and so on. let others focus on outside-the-box picks in respect to position or sleeper potential, you\\'ll have plenty of opportunity to out-clever other managers in later rounds. to start, load up on all available superstars - those who put up the sexiest scoring numbers, full-stop - up front. unless there\\'s some ridiculous early run on goalies, i\\'m leaving that position alone until the third round, at minimum, depending on league size. because did you project linus ullmark would leave all other netminders in his fantasy dust ahead of last season? neither did i. but i had sufficient faith in mcdavid, draisaitl, pastrnak meeting, if not exceeding (153 points remains jaw-dropping even months later), early expectations. once through the elite up front, by all means, grab a goaltender. a good one, that plays a lot, for a better-than-average team. a standout defender, if still available, also presents as a nice acquisition - but not at the expense of a high-performing netminder - at this stage. more on those two positions below. after your superstars and a great goalie are secured, feel free to fill out your roster with greater respect to positional need and/or categories. loading up on attractive centers while disregarding those on either wing will limit you in adjusting your lineup throughout the season. there\\'s good reason we harbor extra fantasy love for those eligible at multiple positions. in leagues that overlook specificity of position, and classify all forwards equally (f), continue to draft the best forecast player available. button-hooking back to the value in preparation, mining team previews and other preseason content to determine who\\'s skating where, and with whom, along with schedule hacks and other useful material, can pay out significant fantasy dividends ahead of your draft and beyond. the more you know and all that. test out your strategy with the espn mock draft lobby. draft your team, risk free, and practice drafting today! along with a foundation of sure-fire performers (or as close to), \"overachieving\" sleeper candidates, including those returning from long-term injuries, can help make the difference between fantasy victory and defeat. securing a later-round gem - one that outperforms their projections - goes a long way in challenging for the ultimate crown. often a change in employ makes a significant difference in a player\\'s productivity (for better or worse). does ryan johansen resurge as colorado\\'s new second-line center after last year\\'s dismal showing in nashville? betcha former bruin taylor hall puts up a lot more than 36 points (61 games) in chicago alongside this young buck everyone keeps talking about named connor bedard. keep an eye on our fantasy hockey space for more comprehensive sleeper coverage in the coming days. for record, potential breakout candidate tim stutzle headlined this segment in last fall\\'s version of \\'play to win\\'. the third-year center\\'s haul of 90 points through 78 games later illustrates the value in recognizing a player on the cusp of erupting, especially when placed in a ripe position and surrounded by high-tier supporting talent. in my view, philly\\'s owen tippett, for one, emits this particular breakout scent ahead of 2023-24.  choose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in. create your custom league for free! on the flip side, some players are going to regress. skaters age, change teams/lines, or just can\\'t emulate what amounted to an atypically positive season, months earlier. what\\'s crucial here is identifying not only who presents as a candidate for regression, but by how large a margin. maybe (most probably) erik karlsson doesn\\'t pot 101 points for a second year running, with his new club in pittsburgh. but would you mind a 75-80 point campaign from the veteran blueliner, while he scoots around on a top power play with sidney crosby, evgeni malkin, and (eventually) jake guentzel? i most definitely would not. but what about edmonton\\'s ryan nugent-hopkins or jeff skinner with the sabres? a slip off tage thompson\\'s forward line and the latter might be hard-pressed to kick out another 35 goals and 47 assists. johnny gaudreau and matt duchene earned mentions in this space 12 months ago, and we all know how their seasons unfolded as compared to 2021-22. this isn\\'t to suggest you shouldn\\'t grab such players altogether, just temper expectations and draft them accordingly. with only a handful of performers responsible for carrying several categories, you need consistent play from between the pipes. in conventional h2h points leagues where three to four goalies are shuffled in and out of your active roster, at least one standout operator, good for 60 or so games - igor shesterkin, jake oettinger, andrei vasilevskiy, juuse saros etc. - should be included on your fantasy roster, along with a solid second-tier fantasy netminder. a filip gustavsson or the like. once that one-two g1/g2 punch is secured, pad your goaltending corps with quality tandem-team members - especially those who hold the potential of running with the number one gig - and/or an outlying sleeper candidate. this year\\'s possible ullmark, if you will. new faces in new places also deserve extra thought at this position. could the senators\\' fresh no. 1 joonas korpisalo prove to be this season\\'s alexandar georgiev, fantasy-wise? or are we in for another ho-hum debut showing in ottawa, à la cam talbot (now gone for los angeles). these are the questions that deserve a deeper dive ahead of rounding out your goaltending corps to start. again, this position can\\'t be overlooked as such a limited group is responsible for putting up winning numbers through three, four, or more fantasy categories. managers who strike the right balance in filling their net with the league\\'s busiest and most consistent performers, while still loading up on star skaters out front, will inevitably find themselves in the winning mix by season\\'s end. a (fun) challenge, to be sure, but nobody said this was supposed to be easy. starting your own league is easier than ever! set your league size, select your keepers, and invite your friends to start playing. sign up for free today be the commish! number of league participants, roster size, and ratio of allotted positions split between forwards and defenders all plays a part in building your blue line. for instance, if your daily or weekly lineup requires more than twice as many totalled c, lw, and rw as defensemen, give the latter position a little less attention in your draft. again, look to the cream of the heavy-hitters crop up front do their best work for you. nearly 30 regularly-performing forwards averaged 2.4 fantasy points or more in espn\\'s default league in 2022-23, as compared to only seven defenders. but you still need these skaters, especially in leagues that reward blocked-shots and atoi. there\\'s certainly merit to grabbing an elite performer - a healthy cale makar, rasmus dahlin, roman josi etc. - in the earlier stages of your draft, just not at the expense of a star forward or game-changing goalie. there are too many solid-enough assets available otherwise. think vancouver\\'s quinn hughes or a ready-to-rock-again zach werenski in columbus. it\\'s also worth knowing that nearly 70 regular defenders averaged 1.7 points or more in our standard game. meaning there are plenty of options - with an eye to sleeper potential - from which to choose in padding your roster in later draft rounds. no need to load up early on non-elite blueliners at all. they sure do. while the aforementioned draft strategy largely applies to conventional scoring competition, particularly espn\\'s default game, the inclusion of other custom categories likely necessitates a different approach. for instance, if penalty minutes count in your league, both brady tkachuk and matthew tkachuk should shoot up your pre-draft target list. fantasy competition that rewards blocked shots means taking a fresh look at your list of coveted defenders. islander bo horvat, along with other centers of his drawing ilk, deserve extra attention in leagues that reward regular success in the faceoff dot. do assists carry as much weight as goals? food for scoring thought, no? familiarize yourself thoroughly with your own league\\'s categories - taking into consideration whether stats count for their straight up value or for points (and how many) - and revise your rankings accordingly. don\\'t fall over yourself to draft a banger, who doesn\\'t score as much, if hits are only each worth 0.1 points. our preseason in-depth look into individual categories will also help in preparing you in maximizing value across the board. ready to play? sign up for free today! the type of league itself also matters a whole lot. while most espn managers compete in a h2h points league, there are other options, often requiring an amended approach to roster assembly and season-long management. familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of all leagues available on espn.com here to figure out which best suits your own fantasy tastes. dynasty and keeper competition - where patience and foresight is key - remains popular with many fantasy managers. equipped with few draft picks each season - just like in real head-office life - dynasty managers often have to look ahead two, three, even four seasons in trying to fortify a solid foundation of talent, year in and out. there\\'s always risk in that good number of prospective stars never reach their full projected potential, but that\\'s part of the game. securing the most promising player possible works out often enough. oh, and draft bedard straight away, if possible. keeper leagues are different in that more players are shuffled in and out each season. while you want to maintain the strongest core possible - seven, eight, or more elite players - drafting a talented, perhaps aging, temp isn\\'t necessarily a bad move. are you in position to win in the here and now? then go on and select the scoring veteran who\\'s going to make it happen for you right now. just don\\'t completely disregard young emerging talent in the meanwhile (see again: bedard). mind you, fantasy managers with weaker, rebuilding rosters should instead solely focus on the talent of tomorrow, whether nhl active or not. moving on now, drafting a quality squad isn\\'t nearly enough. unless participating in a set-and-forget seasonal league, keeping your finger on the pulse of which player is accomplishing what, where, and with whom, all the while keeping a keen eye on who\\'s available on the waiver wire is integral to fantasy success. especially early on. players fall injured, lose their scoring mojo, and/or shift up and down their respective lineups regularly enough. while the draft remains the most important three-hour stretch of your fantasy season, it\\'s still possible to make up for a handful of misguided picks through diligent roster fiddling. many a successful manager will boast a very different-looking roster in april as compared to october. while specific roles matter - pavel zacha sports a lot more fantasy sparkle in centering david pastrnak at even-strength and on the power play than he would/has otherwise - it\\'s also important to take the bigger team picture into account. some calgary skaters may have a bit more pep in their scoring step under new bench boss ryan huska. keep an eye on who\\'s responding best to mike babcock\\'s fresh presence in columbus. same applies to the predators under andrew brunette - who\\'s already promising an inspired commitment to offense - and other clubs with new bench bosses (rangers, capitals, ducks). whatever the reason, if there\\'s a more promising positional player available on the wire than on your active roster, switch them out. not in hair-trigger fashion, mind you, but with level-headed foresight. panicking prematurely, particularly in reaction to a players\\' slow start, will get you nowhere fast. and don\\'t disregard the number of transactions permitted throughout the season, ranging from only a handful to an unlimited amount. you won\\'t want to use up them all, or blow your entire faab, in the first few weeks. you want access to that roster-saving, dark-horse goaltender when they blow up sometime in february, don\\'t you? also, bookmark this space. espn\\'s nhl fantasy department rolls out helpful material almost daily, designed to optimize your chances of victory. even one roster substitute could mean the difference between winning and losing that particular week. use those roster slots to your full advantage, even ahead of season\\'s launch. don\\'t shy away from drafting florida defenseman brandon montour, for example, just because he\\'s expected to miss a handful of games following offseason shoulder surgery. not after last season\\'s 73-point campaign, including 33 scored with the extra skater. jam him, or any other not-quite-healthy fantasy asset you fancy, in one of your ir spots and give it a minute. broker \\'em. especially if waiver wire pickings are lean. your roster probably isn\\'t perfect, which means another active manager is also dealing with weakness at some position or another. the act of reciprocal back-scratching can prove win-win for both of you, which is a-okay. focus on the larger task of beating the field. contrary to how some fantasy sport participants comport themselves, forging a successful trade is not about undressing another manager. the ultimate deal benefits both sides, at least to some degree, in filling a respective void. your coveted winger for my competent (yet still somewhat disposable) goalie. an exchange of elderly (but still trucking) stars for up-and-comers in keeper leagues, depending on who\\'s rebuilding and who\\'s on the cusp of winning it all. remember there\\'s a large difference between being competitive and unnecessarily cutthroat. if you\\'ve made it this far, take the next step and sign up for espn fantasy hockey. download the espn fantasy app today!

       " 'mls on saturday, moments after inter miami’s 2-0 win over the new york red bulls, the dozens of reporters who were at red bull arena to cover lionel messi’s mls debut descended into the depths of the stadium to perform their usual post-game duties. both head coaches gave press conferences. players from both teams spoke about what transpired during the match. advertisement there was no shortage of storylines. messi, still the biggest player in global football and the most famous player mls has ever seen, had created miami’s second goal seemingly out of thin air. what had he seen? how had he navigated that sea of opponents? what had he made of the atmosphere and the level of play? some reporters wanted answers to those questions and more on saturday, but they never came. messi did not talk to the media after the match, despite the protests of a few reporters, most notably ron blum from the associated press, which published an update solely about messi’s lack of availability. mls has a long-standing media policy, meant to ensure that its players are available to journalists at every match and training session. the associated press wrote on saturday that it had received prior assurance that messi, like many high-profile players before him, would be subject to that same policy. the league is now characterizing that differently. “there was a misunderstanding regarding lionel messi’s media access,” a league spokesperson said in a statement on tuesday. “he has not violated any guidelines for his media availability in major league soccer.” when reached on tuesday, the ap said it stood by its reporting but declined to comment further on the record. messi did not speak to reporters after miami’s draw against nashville on wednesday evening. outside of a few brief remarks made to apple tv after his debut in leagues cup, he has never done any post-game media during his time in the united states. off the pitch, the argentine has only done a single press conference and a trio of short interviews with a selection of outlets. this is not entirely unexpected. messi has always been a fairly private person, only granting interviews to trusted reporters in argentina and spain, where he has spent the bulk of his life. at the tail end of a storied career and with millions of followers on his own carefully curated social media channels, he has little personal motivation to speak to reporters. advertisement in the united states, though, players and coaches across most major sports are required to speak with the media after games or other events. fans depend on that access to stay current and media outlets depend on it to accurately convey those events. even this country’s biggest stars — international figures like lebron james, tom brady or michael jordan — have almost always given post-game interviews and done press conferences. that’s simply not the case in other countries, where access is much more limited. and that’s to say nothing of the uniquely american tradition of opening a club’s locker room to reporters after a match, creating an environment where media have relatively unfettered access to any player they want mere moments after their greatest athletic triumphs — or failures. as mls has evolved, the rights the league affords to media have sometimes eroded, with clubs regularly skirting the league’s access policies with little to no consequence. messi’s presence has given mls a massive dose of much-needed publicity and attention, often from the types of outlets that rarely give space to the league, or even to soccer in general. it has also resulted in growing pains, and the exacerbation of issues that predated the argentine’s arrival entirely. it’s worth laying out what, exactly, mls’ media guidelines are. at games, mls clubs are required to provide open access to locker rooms starting 15 minutes after the final whistle. during that period, media enter the locker room and conduct interviews with the players of their choosing. the head coaches from both teams have their own requirements — they give a press conference, which will sometimes also include noteworthy players. in theory, players are also required to be available for a window in the 90 minutes leading up to a match – something reporters rarely, if ever, take advantage of. training sessions throughout the week have their own guidelines — “all practice sessions will have a minimum 15 minute ‘open’ window during practice,” read the league’s media guidelines, for filming and content capture. clubs are also required to make “all players and coaches” available for 15 minutes before or after any given training session. advertisement the athletic has obtained a copy of the 2016 version of the policy, embedded below:  these guidelines were updated in 2017 to encourage more forward-thinking broadcast coverage, like “mic’ing up” players and coaches and placing cameras in locker rooms or in team talks. the league says it worked with players, broadcast partners, club staff and the major league soccer players association to help craft those guidelines. a league source said this week that mls is once again in the process of revising its media policies. technically, every player in the league is subject to the media guidelines, messi included. yet the idea that a man who many call the greatest player in the history of football would answer questions from reporters after every match, or training session — or in the hours leading up to a match, even — has always seemed a little farcical when he has never been asked to do any of that before. indeed, messi and his representation have their own arrangement with the league and inter miami, though it remains unclear exactly what that entails. on tuesday, a league source said the entire arrangement is very much a work in progress. another source, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, characterized messi’s obligations as “a handshake sort of deal” where the player simply pledged to do the media he chooses to, when he chooses to. inter miami could not be reached for comment. mls has had its share of international megastars during its 28-year history. david beckham, zlatan ibrahimovic, wayne rooney and a host of others have featured in the league, and they have all handled media in their own way. few fully adhered to the league’s official media policies, but some were shockingly accessible given their profile. during his time with the red bulls, french legend thierry henry was regularly available post-game, sometimes doing media scrums in a weight room at red bull arena adjacent to the locker room. rooney met with reporters at his locker after nearly every match he played in mls, with few exceptions. he remains available, for the most part, as a head coach of d.c. united. he has regularly used his platform to push mls to reform any number of issues: travel accommodations, officiating and the like. “in england, you speak to the press after a game, they have a different way of handling it,” rooney told the athletic in 2019, “because you know if you don’t do well, they’ll try and angle to get you to say something, maybe, about your teammate or something. over here i feel that the questions are more honest questions and i feel you get a more honest answer with them.” advertisement none of these players, though, were available to every credentialed media member on any given day, as the league’s policy requires. many of the league’s higher-profile players have far busier schedules than their teammates: media appearances, commercial obligations and the like. others simply have the leverage to ignore the league’s media policies en masse. the league and its clubs have at times endeavored to educate big-name players on the media environment they’re entering when they sign an mls contract. in orlando, the club showed kaka, among the biggest-name players to have ever played in the united states, videos of lebron james speaking to media in order to land that point. didier drogba was open with media during his time in montreal (and later in arizona, in the usl) in part because the league does its best to set expectations. other players, though, have struggled to adapt. “they freak out about it,” mls commissioner don garber told reporters in 2016, a year before the league revised its media policies. “we needed to get our owners to say, ‘you’re here now, you’re making a lot of money, more money than they’d make overseas,’ and they have to understand that the media needs the information that you can give them while they’re covering the match.” maybe the most direct analog to lionel messi is david beckham, the english legend who joined the la galaxy in 2007 and now co-owns the team messi plays on. beckham was a global celebrity before he touched down in mls, and his arrival in la massively amplified the media presence of the league and the galaxy. he gave many interviews during his time in the united states and was generally available after every match the galaxy played — and often after training sessions. his profile, like messi’s, largely eliminated the possibility of media speaking to him in front of his locker, but he typically spoke with reporters during the club’s post-game press conference, which would likely be the setting best-suited to messi, if he ever chooses to talk to reporters after a match. that said. messi’s footprint dwarfs beckham’s, and he has arrived with different goals. beckham was very much the latest in a line of soccer emissaries – players who came to the united states not only for the payday and the competition but also to “grow the game.” maybe beckham, like pelé before him, felt more of a compulsion or obligation to interact with media as part of that responsibility. messi does not feel that sense of obligation. in his only american press conference to date, the argentine was asked by the athletic’s felipe cárdenas what he thinks of that perception, that he is the latest in a line of players brought to the united states to bring soccer more firmly into the mainstream. advertisement “my decision to come here happened for many reasons,” said messi. “…but honestly i don’t think of all of that. i simply came here to play, to continue enjoying football, which is what i’ve liked my entire life. and i chose this place in this moment for that, over all things.” in mls, the open locker room is no longer the norm despite it still being part of the policy. many clubs have instead chosen to bring select players out into a “mixed zone” outside the locker room, or in a conference room. clubs also regularly decline to make players available post-match and players sometimes leave before the league’s designated period for post-game availability is over. the league adjusted its policies during covid-19, replacing its in-person opportunities with teleconferences. in may of 2021, mls went back to its open locker room policy; in an email to club officials, the league made it clear that there should be “no exceptions.” earlier this week, a source involved in the conversations surrounding the league’s current and future policies stated that the league has “no intention” of doing away with the open locker room. not everyone is happy about that. some clubs have jostled with the league over locker room access, said multiple sources involved in those conversations, doing their best to abandon the open-locker-room policy altogether. but by and large, the league is keen to keep its access policies in line with the four major leagues in america: the nfl, nba, mlb and nhl. messi aside, mls is still working towards national and international relevance and still needs all the coverage it can get. restricting media access would seem counterproductive. in many cases, speaking to a player outside of the locker room works fine, and to an outsider, the idea of speaking to players in such an intimate setting might feel bizarre. but players and journalists alike have often appreciated the more personal approach. and in an era where so much content can feel carefully manicured and sterilized, the act of speaking to an athlete just moments after they leave the field can be transformative for a story. players, too, sometimes use personal interactions with journalists in the changing room to offer insight or commentary in a one-on-one setting that they wouldn’t in a mixed zone in front of dozens of reporters, many of whom they don’t have any prior relationship with. but regardless of what happens with that policy, it’s likely that exceptions will continue.

       " \"it is just four months since wales lost 264 caps’ worth of test experience in a single day and yet, somehow, they have overcome that disastrous preparation to become the first team to reach the quarter-finals of the world cup. warren gatland’s magic touch seemed absent on his return as wales coach during a disastrous six nations campaign marred by strike threats, a record defeat by scotland and a regional game on the brink of collapse. when alun wyn jones and justin tipuric then retired on the same day midway through the world cup buildup, it seemed that welsh rugby was staring into the abyss. but gatland has shown that when it comes to world cups, no one is better at getting a team up to speed – not even eddie jones, whose australia side wales thumped 40-6 in lyon to all but end the wallabies’ hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. despite the prospect of a first group stage exit for australia, jones maintains the backing of his players, but it is nothing compared to the unyielding loyalty shown to gatland after another miraculous turnaround gareth davies, the scrum-half, is one of those who has been a beneficiary of the 60-year-old’s return, re-establishing himself as first choice in the no 9 jersey. he scored the opening try in lyon after three minutes and after the game explained how gatland has revitalised the side. “we had lots of changes, coaches, and that’s just made a difference. we are all back to where we want to be because of this management,” davies said. “we are fighting for each other, playing for each other and the environment is good. we’re enjoying our time off the pitch, it’s a good bunch of boys here. it shows on the pitch. “warren has just got his way and it works for me and it obviously works for everyone else in the squad.” it is not just the players who have appreciated gatland’s return, with the forwards coach, jonathan humphreys, having worked under both the new zealander and his predecessor wayne pivac. humphreys said: “he’s just taken us back to the dna of this team: be fit, work hard. that’s what everybody hangs their hat on; we believe that we work harder than anybody else and that’s a powerful tool. we’re becoming a very tough team to beat.” while gatland’s wales can now start to dream of a third semi-final in four world cup campaigns, australia and eddie jones are relying on a favour from both georgia and portugal if their own stay in france is to be extended. with a report that jones had interviewed for the japan national team job weeks before the world cup appearing in the sydney morning herald on the day of the crucial match against wales, the heat is very much on the former england coach. but despite that, his players say jones is still the man to lead the side over a crucial four-year period for australian rugby, with a lions tour in 2025 followed by hosting the world cup two years later. will skelton, the wallabies captain, has missed the last two games, losses to fiji and wales, through injury. but he says jones has the vision to turn things around. “we have full trust in him. he’s got the full support of the group. i think his long-term vision and what he wants australian rugby to be back to, i think that’s a positive. sign up to the breakdown the latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed after newsletter promotion “the way he is around the group, you see in the media he has his persona but when you see him one-to-one, in front of the team, how he speaks, how he directs, the boys follow him, and i do as well. “he is a fantastic coach with a massive rugby iq. we’re learning every day when we’re working with him. it’s one of those things, he simplifies the game for us.” at 31, skelton is aware that he may not be back on this stage in four years’ time but, crucially, jones has also received the support of some of the young core of the wallabies squad, starting with standout loosehead prop angus bell, 22. “eddie’s our coach, what he’s done with our team already has been awesome. this performance wasn’t good enough but that’s on the players, that’s on us.” where australia’s players were keen to share some of the responsibility for their meek displays in france, the overriding response from the welsh contingent was to credit gatland for wales’s renaissance. given their transformation, you can see why. \",\n",
       " 'mls in 2015, mls commissioner don garber made headlines across the pond by suggesting the league he runs is more competitive than the premier league. his reasoning: that while just a handful of teams in the premier league can realistically win the title in any given season, just about every team in mls begins the season believing they have a chance of winning mls cup. advertisement “we see some of the challenges of competing in the premier league,” he said at a soccerex conference in manchester. “we have wealthy owners, but we are very committed to the idea that at the start of every season, every fan can think their team can win a championship. we want someone in kansas city, even though they are smaller than new york city, to think they can win the title.” since 2012, there have been five winners of the premier league: manchester city, liverpool, chelsea, leicester city and manchester united. in spain’s la liga, there have been three winners in the same span; in france, psg has dominated the past decade, winning eight of the last 10 league titles; in italy, juventus won nine in a row during the 2010s and in the bundesliga, the least “competitive” of europe’s top five leagues at the top end, bayern munich have swept every league title since 2013. by contrast, it’s extremely difficult to repeat as champion in mls, even once. the 2023 regular season performance of last year’s mls cup finalists lafc and philadelphia union, who meet this weekend in league play, proves as much. go deeper kroenkes in dispute with fifa over sofi stadium deal for 2026 world cup since a team last had repeat success, there have been nine mls cup winners. lafc collected both the supporters’ shield (given to the team with the best regular season record) and mls cup in 2022, but this year it’s st. louis city, playing their first season in mls, that is leading the western conference despite many pundits (including most of the athletic’s writers) predicting they would finish dead last. for better or worse, it’s by design: mls is supposed to have an equal playing field. the league sits in the awkward position of aspiring to grow while also making the most of its place in the food chain. when a side wins mls cup, for example, they will now almost invariably inevitably spend the winter preparing for bids for their best talent from abroad, and often from europe’s top five leagues.  after their mls cup triumph in 2018, atlanta united sold star forward miguel almiron to newcastle united in the premier league, and while they responded with a solid year – finishing second in the eastern conference and the semifinals of the playoffs – they have failed to qualify for the postseason in two out of the three seasons since. advertisement more recently, after new york city’s title-winning season in 2021, valentin “taty” castellanos departed for la liga with girona. after their 2022 triumph, lafc has since lost gareth bale to retirement, top goalscorer cristian “chicho” arango to liga mx (only later to return to mls with real salt lake) and jose cifuentes, an important cog of the title-winning midfield, to rangers in the scottish premiership. mls clubs will naturally find it very challenging to create dynasties if it is more financially viable for them to sell their best players – though in most cases, the clubs do not even receive the full transfer fee. “we want to develop young players, have them be successful here and then move them on,” houston dynamo general manager pat onstad told the athletic. “i think when you do that, everybody in the club benefits. not just ownership or our salary cap but the players training with that player. when i was in columbus, and zack steffen moved on to manchester city, the guys in that locker room felt honored to play with the guy that went on to play a bit in the premier league and now the championship. i think everybody’s desire is to play in a top-five league, so that’s something we’d like to do.” go deeper atlanta celebrates its incoming, generational status as a u.s. soccer hub that’s not to say lafc has struggled mightily since winning the title last year. no club has posted a more impressive start to the season in over a decade, and only the 2020 seattle sounders can match lafc’s 28 points through the opening 15 games of the regular season. lafc’s issues have surfaced later on in the year, with performances dropping significantly following their concacaf champions league final defeat to club leon. if you ask lafc manager steve cherundolo, the straightforward reason for his side struggling to maintain that electric early season form is the inability of smaller mls rosters, limited to 20 senior players along with up to 10 supplemental players (usually draft picks, homegrown products, and other young or developing prospects) to cope with the schedule that qualifying for continental competition brings. by the end of this season, with a deep playoff run, lafc could have played close to 60 games. “in tournaments like this, if you want to consistently compete in finals and win them, you have to rethink your roster rules and regulations,” cherundolo said after losing the two-legged champions league final 3-1 on aggregate. advertisement “we are at a big disadvantage… money in this game buys quality players. we have a good enough team to win this tournament, but with our scheduling and all of the competitions this year, we had a lot going on. we ended up in the final not at our best moment. roster building is about that. having deeper rosters, more players, and more quality players on your team will allow you to extend those periods of play. every mls team is at a disadvantage now.” for the 2023 season, the mls salary cap is $5.2 million per team, excluding designated players and allocation money that can be used to buy down players’ cap hits. these constraints were once essential to ensure the league remained financially secure. but with clubs like lafc, toronto fc and inter miami, who have signed lionel messi to a monster deal worth over $50 million annually, demonstrating they have the ambition to build rosters with the capabilities to compete consistently in mls and continental competition, cherundolo argues the league is directly hurting its team’s chances of success. last year, for example, the seattle sounders became the first club to win concacaf’s premier club competition since 2000. subsequently, they collapsed to a historically poor 11th-placed finish in the west, the first time the club failed to qualify for the playoffs since joining mls. it is not the first time a team has experienced success in a continental club competition and was unable to replicate it in the league, but the persistent underperformance for american clubs (who arguably possess more star quality than their liga mx counterparts) after mls cup success is at least partly influenced by the league’s restrictions on building a roster with strength in depth. despite losing their primary goalscorer and bale, whose primary contribution came in the mls cup final, lafc has retained the core of their squad while using the summer transfer window to strengthen their team with versatile players capable of contributing in several positions. as defending champions in this iteration of mls go, they are about as well placed as possible to fight deep into the playoffs. well, about as well-placed as you can be in a format that relies on hitting form at precisely the right time. but a front office should not have to prioritize jack-of-all-trades to compete for silverware. messi’s arrival brings millions of eyeballs worldwide to a league desperate for coverage in a saturated u.s. sports market. competitiveness is great within reason, but it should not hinder the franchises that aspire for sustained success.

       " \"eddie jones’s australia are on the brink of group-stage elimination for the first time after little went right for his team in lyon it occurred around the 26th minute mark. david porecki, the latest australian to have the captaincy thrust upon him by eddie jones, had the ball in his hand eight metres from the welsh try line. a test level hooker, he was about to perform his primary function and throw to the line-out. surely he’d practiced this a thousand times this past week in preparation for one of the most important matches in wallabies history. surely he was in complete synchronicity with his jumpers. surely australian rugby wasn’t so shambolic. instead the ball sailed harmlessly over the top. it landed in the bread basket of jac morgan, wales’ captain who sported wads of tissue up two bloodied nostrils and wore a crazed look all night like a character from a tarantino film. morgan kicked down field and won a 50-22. australia coughed up a penalty. gareth anscombe teed up and slotted three points for a 13-6 lead. this was the beginning of the end. a butterfly’s wing beat gained momentum and, by the full time whistle, left australian rugby and the poor saps tasked with representing it in pieces. there have been bigger losses but surely this must rank as the worst of them all. it means fiji need only five points from their matches against georgia and portugal to dump australia out of the world cup before the knockouts. there were other moments that similarly used as compelling case studies for the visceral decline of a code that now looks bereft of ideas, leadership or inspiration. on 34 minutes australia were building through the phases. it felt like the australia of old. tate mcdermott at scrum-half, one of the few bright lights in an otherwise bleakly dark show, was zipping passes left and right. runners off the shoulder. aggression at the ruck. remember the good ol’ days? then samu kerevi spiralled a pass straight into touch. oh. so this is how it’s going to be from now on? four minutes later rob valetini spotted that the ball was free at the back of the welsh ruck. but rather than pick it up as he was entitled to do, he lost his head and his feet and dived straight over it, gifting anscombe another shot at goal which he duly slotted. after the restart to kick off the second half, richie arnold leaped high to gather the ball but he lacked the requisite support and was tied up by the hungrier welsh backs. when porecki lost his radar and delivered a skew line-out five minutes down the road, wales won another scrum penalty, giving gareth davies the licence to hoof a speculative kick that ended in a 50-22. from the resulting line-out in australian territory, they went through the phases and anscombe dinked a ball for the onrushing nick tompkins to dot down. where the fullback andrew kellaway was in all this remains a mystery. every time something worked, something else would break down. it all felt completely random at times. surely a knock-on in the back field isn’t connected to a misfiring scrum? is ben donaldson’s restart that sailed straight into touch a symptom of australia’s poor discipline at the breakdown? of course it is. it’s all connected. and the man in the middle must surely cop the most blame. hours before the start of this match, it was reported that eddie jones had held a secret zoom meeting for a potential job elsewhere just days before the world cup. is this a sign that his heart was never really in it? has the pantomime villainy and combative press conferences been nothing but a ruse? is he a puppeteer pulling strings we can’t see or is he just a man out of luck and out of ideas? after this sorry display the answer seems obvious. sign up to the breakdown the latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed after newsletter promotion one wonders where australian rugby goes from here. fans back home will be waking up feeling embarrassed and ashamed. their anger cannot be ignored. jones, to his credit, at least acknowledged that the ire of the supporters is valid. the same can’t be said of rugby australia’s chairman, hamish mclennan, who told disgruntled supporters, “if you don’t like it, don’t watch”. this is up there with “let them eat cake” in terms of callous dismissiveness. if mclennan isn’t careful, he may alienate his entire base before long. when carter gordan, a young man treated like a rag doll because of poor management above him, missed his penalty touch finder near the end of the match, thereby handing possession back to wales, throngs of fans in gold made their way to the exit. it’s a mission getting from lyon’s city centre to the stadium and it’s a long way to go for only a portion of a rugby match. but they’d seen enough. this might not be rock bottom but australian rugby has dug through a layer of earth that had never been plumbed before. how much deeper can it go before there’s no one left to haul it back out? \"]"
